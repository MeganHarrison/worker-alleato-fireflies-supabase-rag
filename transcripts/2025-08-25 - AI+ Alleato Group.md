## Transcript
**Aortiz**: Sam.
**Bclymer**: Morning.
**Aortiz**: Morning.
**Bclymer**: How are you doing?
**Aortiz**: Well, how are you?
**Bclymer**: Oh, good.
**Bclymer**: How was the weekend?
**Jdawson**: Hello.
**Jdawson**: Good morning.
**Jdawson**: Hi guys.
**Bclymer**: Hi, Ashley.
**Bclymer**: Good.
**Jdawson**: How are you guys?
**Aortiz**: Ashley, you can just come to my office.
**Jdawson**: Oh, okay, perfect.
**Aortiz**: Shut that.
**Aortiz**: You can sit down.
**Aortiz**: You don't have to stand.
**Jdawson**: I wasn't sure if I should sit here or just right here.
**Aortiz**: Whatever you want to do, it doesn't matter.
**Aortiz**: Yeah, you can see.
**Aortiz**: So.
**Aortiz**: All right, so the biggest thing like, you know, I'll go ahead and share this.
**Aortiz**: You can see, you know, so, so if you guys listen to, listen to that audio that I sent you, the damn Martel.
**Aortiz**: Did you get a chance to listen to that, Maria?
**Aortiz**: Yeah.
**Aortiz**: Okay, so here's the, here's some my, my notes, you know, from it.
**Aortiz**: I'm not sure if I sent this to you guys or not.
**Bclymer**: No, you didn't.
**Aortiz**: Okay, I'll send this to you guys.
**Aortiz**: So the biggest thing right is if you heard right, like AI is the future by far.
**Aortiz**: Right.
**Aortiz**: And so us figuring out how to implement that more and more into our everyday tasks are important.
**Aortiz**: And so if you listened in that he talked about this stuff right here, the generative voice, generative photos, you know, all these kind of different generative AIs that can really help.
**Aortiz**: And so from a marketing standpoint, you know, that's incredibly valuable is being able to figure out how to use these tools to set up systems to make your guys life easier.
**Aortiz**: Like I know, like for instance, canva, I think has an AI feature or something like that.
**Aortiz**: I don't know if this adobe I would.
**Aortiz**: Yes.
**Aortiz**: Okay.
**Aortiz**: Have you guys played around with that at all?
**Jdawson**: Canva?
**Jdawson**: A little bit.
**Aortiz**: Have you played with that at all?
**Aortiz**: Yes, the AI stuff.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Aortiz**: Okay, so the biggest thing is I want to, you know, like looking at what you guys do in your day to day, you know, especially on the marketing piece because I want to, I want to be able to, you know, to up our post and get, you know, probably at the end of this year, ideally at the latest, is probably phase out Carlton Creative to where we're doing all that stuff in house.
**Aortiz**: I don't, I mean, I don't know unless you think differently, Maria.
**Aortiz**: I don't know how much we necessarily need them.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so one thing is, I mean, and actually I wanted to ask if they're actually are doing like a lot of improvement on LinkedIn because they actually just working on one social media platform right now, which is LinkedIn.
**Bclymer**: Obviously I'm having, I'm copying everything that they're creating to Instagram And Facebook.
**Bclymer**: I think one thing that I like though about them is that, for example, if we have videos for something immediately, they just fix it, like quickly and then obviously send it to us just for approval.
**Bclymer**: But that's done.
**Bclymer**: We can try to do it with AI, as you mentioned.
**Bclymer**: So we can try to do that.
**Bclymer**: I think we have to transition slowly just to make sure we at least have a calendar of things that we can do for social media that at least we're posting, like you said, every day.
**Bclymer**: Like I was saying to you, if we have like a project already on the website from there already.
**Bclymer**: So we have a project, let's create a blog post, let's create a post and then if we have the video, let's do something with the AI video and then let's post it.
**Bclymer**: So if we.
**Bclymer**: I think we need them a little bit right now till we transition, like in a very better, you know, calendar and content understanding for us.
**Bclymer**: Because of course, you know, Annika has all these schedule and everything, which is good.
**Bclymer**: And we need to get to that as well to have like a very well organized things that we're sharing.
**Bclymer**: So I will say we'll need them till we transition.
**Bclymer**: Good.
**Bclymer**: But I think we still need them for a little bit.
**Aortiz**: Well, yeah, that's what I was saying.
**Aortiz**: I was saying end of the year, you know, that's September, October, November edition.
**Aortiz**: But it's four months, you know, so I mean.
**Aortiz**: And again, this is.
**Aortiz**: We can always adjust, right?
**Aortiz**: It's just looking at.
**Aortiz**: This is.
**Aortiz**: You know, I don't, I.
**Aortiz**: And I don't know, like when you say the video, right.
**Aortiz**: Like, what do you mean exactly?
**Aortiz**: Like you send the video to them and it comes back.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So it's just, for example, approval from Jesse or from you.
**Bclymer**: Sometimes it's like the video is good.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, good to go.
**Bclymer**: So Annika videos and then she's just making all.
**Bclymer**: Everything look, you know, like adding everything.
**Bclymer**: And then the mediums that we have, she's like, okay, approve.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Or not.
**Bclymer**: So obviously the.
**Bclymer**: Those little touches of the logo and you know, the, the title and these and that.
**Bclymer**: So that's what they're doing.
**Bclymer**: Good.
**Bclymer**: And then we just.
**Bclymer**: It's just a matter of posting them.
**Aortiz**: That's like.
**Aortiz**: So adding, adding that logo and all that kind of stuff.
**Aortiz**: Is that something we don't know how to do?
**Bclymer**: We can do with AI.
**Bclymer**: We can try.
**Bclymer**: I mean, we can have like a template, you know, for the videos and everything.
**Aortiz**: How do they do it?
**Bclymer**: I think Anika has a template too, on.
**Bclymer**: Canva I don't know because they have everything covered from us, so we just, we only can see what they want us to see from that month.
**Bclymer**: But I'm assuming Anika has template that she just, you know, use on Canva and then that's it.
**Bclymer**: So we can use it.
**Aortiz**: What about Adobe that, you know, I mean, that's even better, right?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, even better.
**Bclymer**: With Adobe, that's better actually.
**Bclymer**: Engagement and quality and everything.
**Bclymer**: We can do it.
**Bclymer**: We can have a template and then just put everything.
**Bclymer**: Are you there, obviously?
**Aortiz**: Are you versed?
**Aortiz**: Do you know how to use Adobe well or.
**Bclymer**: Yes, I do, yeah.
**Bclymer**: I used to do design when I was young.
**Aortiz**: So, I mean, is that something like you're, you're, Are you able to.
**Aortiz**: Is it just a time thing or like, is it that you don't know how to go in and do what she does in Adobe or Canva?
**Bclymer**: It's just a time thing, but because obviously just add it to the videos and actually Canva does it sometimes for you.
**Bclymer**: You know, they have like previous templates and it's just a matter of transition and that's it.
**Bclymer**: So it's just a matter of time of me making the video.
**Bclymer**: For example, when you, when I was doing this audio, remember it was super simple to do it on an audition, just like enhancer and everything and then send it.
**Bclymer**: But because I had the time there, if I was doing the videos, for example, the day in the life, that definitely would have more timing to do.
**Bclymer**: It's just a matter of time.
**Bclymer**: But doing it, it's not a problem.
**Aortiz**: So then that goes back to like, you know, like, you know, even the book, you know, buy back your time.
**Aortiz**: Right.
**Aortiz**: So like, what are the repetitive tasks that we continue to do that we can outsource?
**Aortiz**: Right?
**Aortiz**: Because if you can outsource by using some sort of automation, right, an AI of some sort, and you can get back 10 to 20% of your time, then I mean, that's huge.
**Jdawson**: Can I include something real fast?
**Jdawson**: I would love to help Maria too, if you want to like, guide me in the beginning of like how you work things usually.
**Jdawson**: I would love to help with that.
**Aortiz**: Yeah.
**Aortiz**: So, yes, Maria, yeah, if you can, you can add her to the, to the marketing meeting.
**Bclymer**: Of course.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: I think you added it already.
**Bclymer**: Ashley.
**Jdawson**: We have, we attended the last one.
**Jdawson**: I think it was last week, but Anika just didn't.
**Jdawson**: She thought the schedule messed up.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: So we have.
**Bclymer**: It's supposed to be on Mondays today, but she just changes for tomorrow.
**Bclymer**: Probably she's busy Today.
**Bclymer**: So tomorrow we have the meeting that we were supposed to have today.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Aortiz**: Okay.
**Aortiz**: So, yeah, so, you know, and.
**Aortiz**: And again, like this, you know, this.
**Aortiz**: You know, we were talking about marketing, but, you know, if you think about the things that, again, that we're doing every day, you know, whatever that looks like.
**Aortiz**: I mean, the.
**Aortiz**: The thing that I would say is, over the next week, like, both of you take time and go and explore and figure out, all right, what is some AIs that I can do and that can alleviate tasks, right?
**Aortiz**: Like.
**Aortiz**: Like, what can I replace to utilize?
**Aortiz**: And a lot of that is just as simple as, you know, getting on chat GPT.
**Aortiz**: Do you have a ChatGPT account?
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I do with us.
**Jdawson**: Oh, actually, no, I just use my personal.
**Jdawson**: Like, my personal.
**Jdawson**: I have it, like, on my phone, and I have premium.
**Jdawson**: So I just signed into my email, my work laptop.
**Aortiz**: Okay, so I'll.
**Aortiz**: Let me send you an invite.
**Aortiz**: Invite.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I know this is a random comment.
**Jdawson**: In China, they're, like, teaching all the students, like, AI tools, and it's slowly going to, like, super advance and like, the world's Bahai, like, in a few years.
**Aortiz**: Yeah, it's.
**Aortiz**: It's crazy.
**Aortiz**: Um, so, yeah, so if we can, you know, like over the next week, right, like, you know, each one of you guys go and look and explore, you know, and if, again, if you got to sign up for trials or this, that, the other, you know, whatever, you know, let's do that.
**Aortiz**: But see, like, what can I use to apply to, you know, to help, you know, automate something, right?
**Aortiz**: You know, just exploring and seeing.
**Aortiz**: And again, so sometimes it's going into Chat GPT and being all right, hey, like, I'm trying to do this.
**Aortiz**: Like, what are some, you know, give me some latest AIs I can try, right, to do stuff that we can use.
**Aortiz**: So, yeah, so I just want to make sure that we're using it.
**Aortiz**: So, like, every day, you know, just take time to just use it to talk to every morning, right?
**Aortiz**: Like, if you have.
**Aortiz**: If you include it in your, you know, in your everyday thing, like, if you listened in that talk Dan Martell talked about every morning, he'll go in, just chat with it, right?
**Aortiz**: You know, just to do something.
**Aortiz**: You know, I. I'm, you know, I'm blocking out an hour every day to just go in and try to explore and see how I can, you know, relate it to.
**Aortiz**: To our business.
**Aortiz**: Like, I was using the Chat GBT agent to go into my notion and to code my expenses.
**Jdawson**: Oh, Wow.
**Jdawson**: I didn't know.
**Jdawson**: Oh, okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I'm new to the agent.
**Jdawson**: I think it was, like, recently added, a few months ago.
**Aortiz**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: But I know, like, it takes, like, time to, like, process everything and then you just go back, do a few tasks.
**Jdawson**: You go back and then they.
**Jdawson**: Boom.
**Jdawson**: They've already, like, processed everything for you.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, you can code it to you, like, really good.
**Aortiz**: Yeah, I mean, it coded, you know, I mean, it, you know, I had some.
**Aortiz**: Some errors and stuff.
**Aortiz**: You know, first I just said, you know, you have to work through it, but, like, I was just trying to see what all it, you know, what all it can do.
**Aortiz**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Aortiz**: You know, things that I hate doing.
**Jdawson**: I have to try that out.
**Aortiz**: Engine.
**Aortiz**: Yeah.
**Aortiz**: And so whenever you get the invite, you'll.
**Aortiz**: You get a pro account with us.
**Jdawson**: Oh, okay.
**Aortiz**: Okay.
**Aortiz**: Because we have an enterprise account.
**Jdawson**: Okay, perfect.
**Aortiz**: So, yeah, so, like, because you can see here, like, you know, in these notes that, you know, like, what are, you know, what are one to three workflows in my business that if I can.
**Aortiz**: You use AI can save time.
**Aortiz**: So I said lead generation, coding, transactions, looking up code for FM 8:34 questions.
**Aortiz**: So different things like that.
**Aortiz**: And this is his AI adoption ladder.
**Aortiz**: Right.
**Aortiz**: So this is chat play.
**Aortiz**: I use it weekly.
**Aortiz**: This is basically where we're at here.
**Aortiz**: Ideally, as you get more advanced, you're using stuff.
**Aortiz**: So when you get into APIs, you know, that are automatically doing stuff that's ideal, even custom pioneering stuff that's very advanced, you know, but if we can, you know, even.
**Aortiz**: Even getting into systems and processes is a big leap for us.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Aortiz**: You know, I mean, you know, like we, you know, we played around with that fixer AI, you know, I think AJ's playing around with it, and that's valuable.
**Aortiz**: I think I just, I didn't put the.
**Aortiz**: I got to put the time into, you know, really play with it and set up the rules.
**Aortiz**: That's another thing I had.
**Aortiz**: I had ChatGPT agent.
**Aortiz**: I said, go into my email and go look through it and act as if you are the world's greatest executive assistant and tell me what I should have you do to help me become more effective, you know, and it would go.
**Aortiz**: It was going through and reading all my emails and whatever, you know, now granted, I.
**Aortiz**: There were 6,500 unread ones and, you know, so over, you know, 15,000 emails or whatever.
**Aortiz**: So it was very daunting.
**Aortiz**: And didn't get through it.
**Aortiz**: I got through like half a day.
**Aortiz**: I was like, all right.
**Aortiz**: I was like, all right.
**Aortiz**: It takes a little long for that, but yeah, those are, those are just, again, some examples of what we can be doing, you know, to help us to.
**Aortiz**: To be more efficient.
**Aortiz**: I think the, you know, as far as like, content and stuff, like doing the, the B roll in, you know, automatic stuff.
**Aortiz**: Right.
**Aortiz**: Like, so, like.
**Aortiz**: Oh, right, you know, I've got.
**Jdawson**: It's called like Script, for example.
**Jdawson**: Like, we would sort of generate the post and then kind of like schedule the post to do every day instead of doing it manually.
**Jdawson**: Would that, like, be an example, like, create all the posts and then insert it.
**Jdawson**: Have it scheduled to, like, every day.
**Jdawson**: It'll, like, make a post and it's already, like, reviewed by us or AI just so it's like faster.
**Bclymer**: We don't have to manually.
**Aortiz**: Like things like even creating a content calendar.
**Aortiz**: Right.
**Aortiz**: It can do that.
**Aortiz**: Like, and so it's, you know, remember when we do it, it's.
**Aortiz**: You want to give it, you know, all right, you know, who is it?
**Aortiz**: What's the goal?
**Aortiz**: Like, you know, your prompts, you know, look like that and yeah, you know, one tactic that I learned from.
**Aortiz**: In that presentation from Dan, you know, he talked about, like, if he gets a response that he really likes from, you know, ChatGPT or whatever, then he'll ask the question, be like, what prompt would I need it should I have given you in order to get this response?
**Aortiz**: Oh, say if you would have said this, you know, that, that, that kicks out this response and it can help to make you a better prompt writer.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so he's pretty.
**Jdawson**: Okay, gotcha.
**Jdawson**: Okay, sounds good.
**Aortiz**: Yeah.
**Aortiz**: And a lot of times it's just talking to it.
**Aortiz**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, like asking the right questions.
**Aortiz**: Yeah, like, so like this, like descript.
**Aortiz**: Right.
**Aortiz**: So this is, you know, this is an AI video thing.
**Aortiz**: Let's see here.
**Jdawson**: And you guys use descript for your postings?
**Aortiz**: No, I just, I can't remember what I use this for.
**Aortiz**: I'm going to look it up actually right now because I just happen to see where we get charged for it.
**Bclymer**: I think you use it for.
**Bclymer**: You wanted to create a video for.
**Aortiz**: Oh, yeah.
**Bclymer**: So presentation explaining something.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: For I think one of the proposals.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Aortiz**: Yep.
**Aortiz**: Yeah.
**Aortiz**: Yeah.
**Aortiz**: So I was just using it to help create and I think I was just playing with it.
**Aortiz**: I don't know.
**Aortiz**: I'd have to look and see what all.
**Aortiz**: We can really use it for.
**Aortiz**: Cheese without fat nut.
**Jdawson**: It's just the lighting.
**Aortiz**: Yeah.
**Aortiz**: You're so sweet.
**Aortiz**: Oh, yeah.
**Aortiz**: So, yeah, we did this one.
**Aortiz**: We were playing around with it.
**Aortiz**: So, yeah, I don't like AI speakers.
**Aortiz**: You know, I don't have brain CEO.
**Aortiz**: I'd have to look and see what all this is.
**Aortiz**: But anyway, like, you know, this is just an example of one that I can't remember how I ran across it, but I was, you know.
**Aortiz**: You know, this is something to play with, I'd say.
**Aortiz**: But yeah, like, this is again, just one example, you know, AI, video maker, whatever.
**Jdawson**: Oh, like, like, can you give me an example of like, a video you would, like, want to create for, like, is it our social media or like our company?
**Jdawson**: Or like, when we have meetings, you want to show the people we're talking to, like, how to use something?
**Aortiz**: Well, so like, I do.
**Aortiz**: So I do the videos a lot of times where, like, I'll create a how to video.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Aortiz**: Stuff.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Aortiz**: So, you know, there's, there's different.
**Aortiz**: You know, I had sent a video out to the company, I don't know, a while ago about creating SOPs and checklists.
**Aortiz**: Like, there's a couple.
**Aortiz**: Couple different, you know, things like I think scribe and I can't remember what other ones there were that I had sent out.
**Aortiz**: You know, that can be utilized.
**Aortiz**: But yeah, as far as like, you know, and again, I say marketing video, but I'm just using those examples.
**Aortiz**: Like, the goal is to.
**Aortiz**: What can we use, you know, to help take away repetitive tasks.
**Aortiz**: Right.
**Aortiz**: You know, even if it's something is like, you know, our guys, like, we send out weekly reports every week.
**Aortiz**: Right.
**Aortiz**: Was there a way to automate that somehow or, like, make it easier to.
**Aortiz**: Where instead of those guys going in and hand typing everything and adjusting the pictures, like, you know, is there a way to do that, you know, with some sort of AI, you know, you know, like tracking things, like, just different.
**Aortiz**: Whatever it is that we can do, you know, to remember, you know, like this, like, I'm gonna check out this precision.
**Aortiz**: AI says it can do a full analysis of your business.
**Aortiz**: Right.
**Aortiz**: Like, I'm gonna.
**Aortiz**: That's interesting to me.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Aortiz**: You know, lead generation.
**Aortiz**: I gotta look at those things.
**Aortiz**: Like, what are some different AIs I can use to help do Legion?
**Aortiz**: You know, to help with that.
**Aortiz**: Yeah.
**Aortiz**: So like this, like, Munch AI Opus AI, you know, they can go through and do video and create clips, you know, different.
**Aortiz**: And again, all this is in his, you know, in his speech that I did.
**Aortiz**: But yeah, I mean, that's the, that's the goal is just like, like, let's.
**Aortiz**: Let's make it a point to go in and research and figure out what it is that we can help, you know, because in, in five years, there'll be two types of businesses.
**Aortiz**: Those that utilize AI and those that are out of business.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Aortiz**: You know, we want to be the.
**Aortiz**: We want to be the former, not the latter.
**Aortiz**: And so the sooner that we can get this up, the better we can.
**Aortiz**: We can do.
**Aortiz**: And that gives us a little more bandwidth, you know, makes it to where we're not stuck doing the things we don't want to do all the time.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Aortiz**: You know, to make some life more enjoyable.
**Aortiz**: Focus on doing things that you want to do, not the things that you have to do.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Aortiz**: What questions do you guys have?
**Jdawson**: I think you pretty much answered everything.
**Jdawson**: I was curious to ask, like, what is fixer AI?
**Jdawson**: Like, is it mainly like the guys that use it for like, PSRs or like, stuff they insert?
**Aortiz**: Fixer AI email AI.
**Bclymer**: Oh.
**Aortiz**: So to see here.
**Aortiz**: So this goes in and it'll automatically like, create responses and like all this, like, flag different things, like in your email to where like, you know, you can go in here and it's already like, you know, needs your attention and all that kind of stuff.
**Aortiz**: Now the, you know, the biggest thing and this is what I ran into, like trying it, is that you have to teach it, you know, like.
**Aortiz**: And I just didn't take the time to teach it.
**Aortiz**: But like, again, this.
**Aortiz**: That's just an example, right.
**Aortiz**: Of an A.I.
**Jdawson**: I know.
**Jdawson**: I use something that's like.
**Jdawson**: It's like a script AI.
**Jdawson**: It's like free.
**Jdawson**: It's like not like super hindsight for like my emails and it just like catches like all my grammar mistakes.
**Jdawson**: I could rephrase like sentences.
**Aortiz**: It's.
**Aortiz**: It's embedded in your email.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it's embedded in like my.
**Aortiz**: What's it called?
**Jdawson**: I can't remember.
**Jdawson**: It's like something script.
**Jdawson**: Let me go ahead and check my phone.
**Jdawson**: But it's like embedded in my chat GPT and like my cl.
**Jdawson**: It's like I can go check.
**Aortiz**: It's not.
**Jdawson**: I mean, it's like this green like pen.
**Jdawson**: It's like a free AI.
**Jdawson**: I can like just send a random text of like what it is.
**Aortiz**: Yeah, that's fine.
**Aortiz**: You can just.
**Aortiz**: But yeah, I mean, like I said, that's a.
**Aortiz**: You know, another good thing.
**Aortiz**: Looks like AI email assistant for Outlook.
**Aortiz**: So they've got one here.
**Aortiz**: It looks like copilot.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I use.
**Jdawson**: I think it is copilot.
**Jdawson**: No, no, I don't use Copilot.
**Jdawson**: I know that's like a.
**Jdawson**: When you're on, like, Outlook, if you want to search something up, it's like, it's like a different version of Chat GPT.
**Aortiz**: Gotcha.
**Aortiz**: Yeah.
**Aortiz**: Again, there's tons of different ones, right?
**Aortiz**: You've got, you know, Gemini Quad.
**Aortiz**: I mean, all those different ones.
**Aortiz**: So, yeah.
**Aortiz**: Maria, you got any questions?
**Bclymer**: No, I think I have.
**Bclymer**: Also, there's this guy that I follow on LinkedIn that he usually posts, like, at least 100 new AI tools that are coming every week because, like, you mentioned, there's a bunch.
**Bclymer**: So what I was going to do is just share them with Ashley so we can have like a list of actually AI that we can use, you know, for, for us and then just, you know, have like a next meeting and kind of like go through them and make sure if this is something that it works for us.
**Bclymer**: But I'm going to share it with you.
**Bclymer**: He is posting every day.
**Bclymer**: Well, not every day.
**Bclymer**: Probably like once a week about new AI tools.
**Bclymer**: So I will just start them there, you know, just to make sure it kind of matches the business.
**Bclymer**: So, yeah, I'll work on something with.
**Aortiz**: Ashley so we can help that one.
**Aortiz**: One thing I, you know, seen or heard of is like, you know, which I think is pretty cool, like on a marketing standpoint is, you know, having AI go in and identify the top, you know, like, let's say LinkedIn accounts, you know, they get the most engagement in XYZ sector, right?
**Aortiz**: So it's like if we want to look at like, you know, national design build firms or national GCs, and you can say, like, you know, companies like this, this, this, this, you know, what are like the top music.
**Aortiz**: And then, you know, it finds those, and then they like, list out those posts, right?
**Aortiz**: Which ones get the, you know, the most ones.
**Aortiz**: Then you say, all right, I go in and recreate these posts so that they're Alito branded.
**Bclymer**: Oh, wow.
**Aortiz**: We can essentially piggyback off of that post.
**Aortiz**: Success, right?
**Aortiz**: And so that's when you get into, you know, you can do numerous steps with different AIs to like, okay, so we've got, you know, this blog post.
**Aortiz**: All right, so we're going to rewrite this, you know, and put our spin on it, you know, or like, we're going to create a video or this, that and the other, like, we can recreate because at the end of the day, right, most of these ideas are not original.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, they're piggybacked.
**Aortiz**: Yeah.
**Aortiz**: Four walls and a roof.
**Aortiz**: You know, like it's, you know, construction hasn't changed a ton in, you Know, the last thousand, two thousand years, like, it's still the same concepts.
**Aortiz**: The biggest thing is your.
**Aortiz**: Your delivery.
**Aortiz**: Right.
**Aortiz**: And communication.
**Aortiz**: Like, how are you communicating your messaging?
**Aortiz**: That's essentially what the difference is between people who get a lot of engagement and those who don't.
**Aortiz**: You know, I mean, most of the message.
**Aortiz**: Most of the messages that we do, whether it be construction, whether it be even, you know, like, in the Tony space.
**Aortiz**: Right.
**Aortiz**: Personal development.
**Aortiz**: Like, you know, like, a lot of stuff, you know, he did, you know, he added his own spin to it.
**Aortiz**: You know, his delivery method may be different, but a lot of this stuff is pretty basic.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Aortiz**: Like, it's been the same stuff, Todd.
**Aortiz**: It's just doing it day in and day out, stay disciplined, wake up, do these things.
**Aortiz**: Like, it's.
**Aortiz**: It's just the same thing that people don't do, but people just teach it differently.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Aortiz**: You know, it's all about that messaging and branding.
**Aortiz**: How can you connect?
**Aortiz**: And so, you know, we're fortunate to have some of these tools.
**Aortiz**: And so we can go, oh, hey, we can look and see who are the big, you know, people making all that, you know, all that engagement.
**Jdawson**: And when you say engagement, you definitely want to, like, get, like, more, like, attention on, like, Instagram and LinkedIn.
**Jdawson**: Like, you want to be at the top.
**Aortiz**: Yeah.
**Aortiz**: The idea is, you know, when you talk about, like, going and getting clients.
**Aortiz**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Aortiz**: So one thing that you have to communicate, like, so I'll send you guys.
**Aortiz**: Todd.
**Aortiz**: Todd Ward.
**Aortiz**: He's got a.
**Aortiz**: Not Todd Ward.
**Aortiz**: Hartley.
**Aortiz**: Todd Hartley.
**Aortiz**: His presentation and everything, you know, from this event as well.
**Aortiz**: I think I have it here.
**Aortiz**: Donald Miller.
**Aortiz**: Yeah.
**Aortiz**: So see, Todd Hartley, you know, here's his stuff.
**Aortiz**: Right.
**Aortiz**: So he mentioned gitmunch again, gamma.com, you know, authority.
**Aortiz**: So, like, here, this is the biggest thing, like, when you're three steps, predictable, legion, Right visibility, get in front of the right buyers, authority, become the trusted, go to expert and then conversion.
**Aortiz**: Turn their trust into your next step.
**Aortiz**: So, like, for instance, like, becoming, you know, a thought leader and, you know, a trusted person to where, like, whenever we, you know, get in front of a client and, you know, say, you know, that we give a proposal.
**Aortiz**: Well, you know, if it's us, but we've got such a huge following and people, like, look at us, and we are the, you know, the standard, the thought leader on that.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Aortiz**: You know, but our price is the most offensive.
**Aortiz**: Well, they're gonna be like, well, you know, these other two people don't know.
**Aortiz**: Like, we already have that authority.
**Aortiz**: To say, this is what it takes.
**Aortiz**: Right.
**Aortiz**: And so that's a big thing when we talk about engagement.
**Aortiz**: Right.
**Aortiz**: Is if we're putting out good quality content where, you know, people are, you know, like, you, like, you talked about that guy that puts out the different AIs, right?
**Aortiz**: He has authority, right?
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Aortiz**: Like, you already, like, if you messaged him or he messaged you, you know, like, oh, hey, Maria, blah.
**Aortiz**: Like, you need to look at this, this and this, you would automatically do that.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Aortiz**: Because he's, because he's got that authority.
**Aortiz**: Right.
**Aortiz**: And so that's the same thing that we have, like.
**Aortiz**: So, like, you know, in our company, you know, me or Jesse have the authority because we have the knowledge.
**Aortiz**: Like, people look to us and we say, no, you need to do this, this, this.
**Aortiz**: Oh, okay, Right.
**Aortiz**: Well, we want to get that same authority across the masses, you know, so that when people, you know, look at Alito and they go, look us up and they're like, oh, my gosh, look at all this stuff.
**Aortiz**: Yeah, these guys know exactly what they're doing.
**Aortiz**: They're.
**Aortiz**: They're the subject matter experts.
**Aortiz**: So when they tell us, hey, man, you need to do this, this and this, they go with it.
**Aortiz**: Yep.
**Aortiz**: You know, I want to be successful.
**Jdawson**: Oh, got it.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So like, for example, you mentioned, like, looking up the best accounts for this category on LinkedIn.
**Jdawson**: We should also do the same like via Instagram and like, via, like our website, like, just to like, upgrade and get the most engagement on everything.
**Aortiz**: Yeah, okay.
**Aortiz**: Yeah, you can look and say, okay, what's the.
**Aortiz**: You find, like, what's the top stuff in LinkedIn and Instagram?
**Aortiz**: And then.
**Aortiz**: Okay, well, what, what's best on each, on each platform?
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Aortiz**: You know, and then you can, you know, carve the messaging out, you know, but the, the goal is, you know, for Alito and, you know, myself, since essentially I am the, the brand is to be that subject matter expert, that thought leader.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Aortiz**: That's what we, we need to get to.
**Aortiz**: That's what marketing is, is creating that authority.
**Aortiz**: You know, people are start following us and looking at us, engaging us to where, you know, we're first of mind, if they have something come up, we're the first thing they think of.
**Jdawson**: And this is like, like a sad add on.
**Jdawson**: We are.
**Jdawson**: I'm trying to get like a small photographer to come into the office to take better photos of Jesse.
**Jdawson**: Because you, I know, are getting professional photos in September.
**Aortiz**: Yeah, usually.
**Aortiz**: Usually we do, like, so we did, I think, I don't know, a year or Two ago I had a photo come in and do headshots for all the employees.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: So I'm planning on like getting Jesse like a few headshots and then everyone else in the office like wearing like the Alito shirt or just like a nice button down outfit and getting a few headshots.
**Jdawson**: She's going to come into the office.
**Jdawson**: We would just do it at the office really fast and then everyone will have a nice photo for their LinkedIn.
**Jdawson**: Maybe like Jesse and you like for like the website or just like get the ball moving.
**Aortiz**: Yeah, yeah, that's something that, you know, people need to have, you know, good shots.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah, for sure.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Because I saw like everyone's photo and I was like, what, what is going on?
**Aortiz**: Yeah, yeah.
**Aortiz**: So yeah, I mean that's again, that's important as well.
**Bclymer**: Let's have also a follow up meeting on this because I do want to show you the AIs that are out there that I think it'll be really helpful for us.
**Bclymer**: And like you said, we might need to have also the time with Ashley to test them out, make sure they're actually ideal for us and making our life easier.
**Bclymer**: So I'll set up a follow up meeting and then Ash, I'll set up a minute with you so we can go with the list of this guy.
**Bclymer**: He has a bunch and I'm sure a lot of them are really helpful for us.
**Bclymer**: And then, yeah, we'll just, you know, we'll show you our ideal ones.
**Bclymer**: We'll test them out of course and we'll let you know also how I look.
**Aortiz**: Yeah, this isn't something that by any means I expect us to solve in a week.
**Aortiz**: This is just, we have to, this is a continuing, I mean just look at again, AI is changing consistently and so there's new stuff coming out that's better and it's just, but we just have to start incorporating and making it part of our daily lives, you know, to, to keep growing and it's, it's more difficult for me to try to get the guys to do it because it's just, you know, construction is very antiquated.
**Aortiz**: It's easier to start here, you know, and us do this stuff and then implement it, you know, to other people.
**Jdawson**: Makes sense.
**Aortiz**: Makes sense.
**Aortiz**: Cool.
**Aortiz**: Awesome videos.
**Jdawson**: Okay, I'm all good.
**Jdawson**: I'm all set.
**Bclymer**: No, I'm good.
**Bclymer**: We just have the executive meeting.
**Bclymer**: You want to talk about it right now?
**Aortiz**: Yeah, we can.
**Aortiz**: Is it right now?
**Bclymer**: Is it nine is now.
**Bclymer**: It's right now.
**Bclymer**: As you can see too.
**Bclymer**: So we usually have these meetings with Brandon related to what he needs, what we're talking, you know, what we're doing at the company.
**Bclymer**: So if you want also to have one with Jesse, it'll be really helpful so you know he can also guide you and also you can talk to him about what we are doing.
**Bclymer**: So for example, Brandon.
**Bclymer**: So we have the GA license happening.
**Bclymer**: They didn't reply to me.
**Bclymer**: They didn't call me back on Friday.
**Bclymer**: So call them back today, leave them a message.
**Bclymer**: So usually 2, 3pm they're going to call us back.
**Bclymer**: So just to let you know.
**Bclymer**: So maybe you're available or not.
**Bclymer**: So we can just ask them what's going on.
**Bclymer**: They're telling me the Last update was August 18th and nothing is showing up on the platform.
**Bclymer**: California was already sent last week.
**Bclymer**: We just need like another week to check what's going on.
**Bclymer**: If we don't receive a letter or a pin.
**Bclymer**: So the guy just told me just call us and then just figure out what's going on there.
**Bclymer**: So that's on our side.
**Bclymer**: That's working.
**Bclymer**: Give me one second.
**Bclymer**: I have my list here.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Other than that, Annika sent some stuff for social media that I'm just going to go ahead and check.
**Bclymer**: Take a look.
**Bclymer**: A video for you for approval and also another type.
**Bclymer**: Type of content that she might need for project that you think we can have in mind to have a.
**Bclymer**: Like a spotlight.
**Bclymer**: I.
**Bclymer**: Which one do you think it'll be good?
**Bclymer**: Like put Will Bloomington or another type of project.
**Aortiz**: I mean what one?
**Aortiz**: I mean have we done Bart yet?
**Aortiz**: I mean that one, you know, finished.
**Bclymer**: Well, let's do Bart if not.
**Bclymer**: She said scope of work, special features, any partners, any vendor you want to tag again?
**Aortiz**: Yeah, I mean there's not a vendor I can think of that we want to tag.
**Aortiz**: I mean that should be highlighting a vendor like that should.
**Aortiz**: I wouldn't think is a every every month thing.
**Aortiz**: Right.
**Aortiz**: That should be a, you know, a coveted spot.
**Aortiz**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Okay, sounds good.
**Bclymer**: I'll ask her as well for that because I think Bart, we haven't done it.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Other than that.
**Bclymer**: So let me check.
**Bclymer**: So working on Will the Tampa event.
**Bclymer**: So that's done transfer.
**Bclymer**: So on September you have this.
**Bclymer**: Don't forget to let me know for the Ryder cop.
**Bclymer**: What did you decide with these guys?
**Bclymer**: Because I need to set up their transportation from the airport to the house.
**Aortiz**: So I'll talk to Mike.
**Aortiz**: We're probably.
**Aortiz**: I don't think Paul's gonna go anymore.
**Aortiz**: Oh yeah.
**Aortiz**: I don't Basically I don't want him to go because he's.
**Aortiz**: He was supposed to help us out on stuff and he just didn't.
**Aortiz**: And I'm like, well, I don't really.

**Aortiz**: I'll find.
**Aortiz**: I've got a meeting here this morning with Arc Edge.
**Aortiz**: So I'm supposed to fly to New York to meet with the president of Estonia.
**Aortiz**: I think that Wednesday.
**Aortiz**: And then.
**Aortiz**: So I'll fly from New York back to here, have the meeting with Contender, and then from here I'll fly back up to New York to go to the Cup.
**Aortiz**: So I imagine I'll talk to Phil and Mike and see if.
**Aortiz**: What they want to do.
**Aortiz**: If they want to.

**Bclymer**: In terms of what we created, for instance, Instagram, we just.
**Bclymer**: I need to ask Samantha to send me the new contract for.
**Bclymer**: Not the contract, the changes you did for the alcohol and the photograph.
**Bclymer**: So I asked her about that.
**Bclymer**: We're going to pay them in full after delivery.
**Bclymer**: And she said that's fine with the people.
**Bclymer**: So I said, okay, that's good.
**Bclymer**: So we're going to do that.
**Bclymer**: Also, I need to call back the guys from the ice sculpture.
**Bclymer**: He got back to me on Friday, but I want.

**Bclymer**: No, I think we need to purchase like a suit for you, something fancy for the day.
**Aortiz**: I don't know.
**Aortiz**: We'll figure that out.
**Aortiz**: Probably not.
**Aortiz**: One thing too.
**Aortiz**: We need to start thinking, you know, you guys probably need put on your.
**Aortiz**: Your agenda here for the end of the year party, you know, so that we're scrambling.
**Bclymer**: Ashley already created a document just to go through it.
**Bclymer**: So I Told her that probably in October.
**Bclymer**: We should go with you guys just to make sure whether we need you mention a barbecue.
**Bclymer**: We just need to know exactly if you want Tampa office because it's new and you want the people to go there or you want to do it in the.
**Bclymer**: In the office.
**Aortiz**: No, I mean it's.
**Aortiz**: It's going to be in the winter, so it's happened in Florida.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so let's do it on.
**Bclymer**: On your office.
**Bclymer**: So Ashley, let's try to make sure we have something there.
**Aortiz**: I mean it doesn't.
**Aortiz**: Doesn't necessarily need.
**Aortiz**: I mean it wouldn't obviously be in our office.
**Aortiz**: Like we'll have to, you know, go somewhere for it.
**Aortiz**: But yeah, we just need to start planning that, figuring out what the budget needs to be and all that.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we have a document already with Ashley.
**Bclymer**: We just need, you know, like just to have a meeting with you, Jesse, just to make sure and give you some options and then just take it from there.
**Bclymer**: We'll take it from there with Ashley.
**Bclymer**: So that's on our list.
**Bclymer**: Other than that, let me check.
**Bclymer**: Well, Puerto Rico has been a mess.
**Bclymer**: I mean I'm trying to yell them in Spanish and still they don't pay me attention.
**Aortiz**: So that's fast.
**Bclymer**: That's.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Anyway, so.
**Bclymer**: So doing that.
**Bclymer**: One second.
**Bclymer**: Brandon B. I'm checking BIM on the thing that we talk about last Friday.
**Bclymer**: Um, and then.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: I don't think I need you right now for anything else that's on my end.
**Bclymer**: Do you need me for anything else?
**Aortiz**: No, the California thing is, is going to be critical.
**Aortiz**: Yes, because that's.
**Aortiz**: I got a meeting with that client here in 20 minutes to hopefully get released for design.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Aortiz**: That's going to happen soon.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I'll keep you posted.
**Bclymer**: I know as myself are on top of it.
**Bclymer**: We just need to.
**Bclymer**: They just told me it has to be two weeks and I said okay.
**Bclymer**: But he said if you are the qualifying party, which I said yes, I.
**Bclymer**: He said like, okay, just call me and we'll just figure it out because you need it urgently.
**Bclymer**: So I said yes.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: So just let me know.
**Bclymer**: And then just now that I have Ashley there, we're going to order some envelopes for the St. Peter office with the logo with the Aldeo group.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: The ones, the last ones I send you work perfect, right?
**Bclymer**: Better than the first one?
**Aortiz**: I think so, yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so Ash, let's just do that.
**Bclymer**: I'll teach you how to do it and how to change everything.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So you know from the future, how to do it.
**Bclymer**: I saw you ordered some stuff for the Amazon business for the office.
**Bclymer**: That's awesome.
**Bclymer**: Don't forget to tell Brandon your ideas of adding some frames now that you have the boss there.
**Jdawson**: Oh, yeah.
**Bclymer**: No.
**Aortiz**: What is it?
**Jdawson**: I was thinking of adding, like, some picture frames, like, just around the office.
**Jdawson**: I noticed, like, the frames that you had in the indie office when AJ was showing me, like, around, like, the posters and stuff.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Like, he showed me the gladiator poster.
**Jdawson**: He showed me, like, the motivational signs.
**Jdawson**: I didn't get to read them, but I noticed, like, they were like, black frames, like, everywhere.
**Jdawson**: So I figured, like, we could get some, like, especially for the front, the hallway, one for each office.
**Jdawson**: I haven't looked into the frames or, like, what we would get, but it's just like an idea.
**Jdawson**: Just, like, get more decoration around.
**Aortiz**: Yeah, I just.
**Aortiz**: All I did was when I did that one, I literally just googled motivational posters, picture frames, and.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Aortiz**: Ordered a bunch of them.
**Jdawson**: Okay, sounds good.
**Jdawson**: And then also I did have the idea and I discussed it with Maria regarding, like, furniture and, like, the little kitchen.
**Jdawson**: I was thinking, like, maybe just like a table with, like, three or four chairs or also, like a go to.
**Aortiz**: Round table or square table or something.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, like a little round table.
**Jdawson**: Just like.
**Jdawson**: So, like, some people have the option to sit, like, elsewhere in their office, at their desk, or like a little, like, shelf to, like, make like, a coffee bar.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if you drink coffee.
**Jdawson**: Just.
**Jdawson**: I saw, like, there were coffee, like, boxes.
**Jdawson**: I figured, like, we had like, a coffee machine that works.
**Aortiz**: Yeah.
**Aortiz**: I mean, I. I'm not a big coffee guy, but I'm sure I know other people.
**Aortiz**: I know Jesse, I think, drinks coffee.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I drink coffee.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I love the coffee.
**Aortiz**: Yeah.
**Aortiz**: We have a coffee machine and stuff up in India, just.
**Jdawson**: Oh, okay.
**Aortiz**: Yeah.
**Aortiz**: So, I mean.
**Aortiz**: Yeah, that's fine.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Perfect.
**Jdawson**: Other than that, besides, like.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I was just thinking frames, decorations and, like, things for the kitchen area.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And we were thinking as well, because you have now, like, five magazines to print those magazines.
**Bclymer**: Just have them there in reception, just, you know, in case.
**Bclymer**: But just to show them.
**Bclymer**: A lido.
**Aortiz**: Yeah.
**Aortiz**: Or something.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Like at the coffee table.
**Jdawson**: I thank you, Marie, for reminding me about that.
**Jdawson**: I forgot.
**Jdawson**: But yes, like, on the coffee table.
**Jdawson**: I think it would look great just to, like, represent, like, the company if anyone were to come in.
**Aortiz**: Yeah.
**Aortiz**: Make sure if you get them printed, they're like, magazine quality.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so I'll share with you the link, Ash.
**Bclymer**: And then we'll just find like a. Oh, no, I know who.
**Bclymer**: Infographics might do really nice printing for magazines.
**Jdawson**: I'll check.
**Aortiz**: I'm sure.
**Aortiz**: But I'll teach FedEx or somebody will do it too.
**Jdawson**: I mean.
**Bclymer**: Oh, really?
**Bclymer**: I didn't know that they can print.
**Aortiz**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Oh, that's good.
**Aortiz**: Yeah.
**Aortiz**: I mean, maybe.
**Aortiz**: I mean, FedEx has been FedEx print, you know, so I mean, I've seen it like on.
**Jdawson**: I've seen the option on their website.
**Jdawson**: Just haven't explored it.
**Aortiz**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Oh, cool.
**Bclymer**: Awesome.
**Bclymer**: I didn't know that.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so let's, let's do that, Ash.
**Bclymer**: So I'll share with you the actual magazine file so we can print the magazine.
**Bclymer**: It's, you know, and have them there.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Other things.
**Jdawson**: Sorry, one more thing.
**Jdawson**: Do you guys like, for like magazines, do you guys, like, try to qualify?
**Jdawson**: I'm not sure exactly how it works for like Inc 5000 or like Tampa or like Indiana, like, biggest office growth.
**Jdawson**: Like, do you.
**Jdawson**: Have you guys, like, ever tried to, like, qualify or like, look into that?
**Aortiz**: No, but that's definitely something to look into.
**Jdawson**: Okay, awesome.
**Aortiz**: Yeah.
**Aortiz**: I mean, like all that.
**Aortiz**: Best place to work.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, like, best places to work because I know it's like once you put your name out there, they just look at.
**Jdawson**: They review your company.
**Jdawson**: Maybe you'll have like a meeting, they'll take some.
**Jdawson**: They'll ask for headshots, you scan it over and then boom.
**Jdawson**: Like in a magazine.
**Aortiz**: Yeah, that's good.
**Aortiz**: And it helps us with recruiting and stuff.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Aortiz**: So one thing too, you know, I know that you're.
**Aortiz**: You're putting together a post for ads and stuff, so.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Aortiz**: So one thing, like, to think about, right?
**Aortiz**: And this is kind of like how I typically will, you know, run the company, is if you do things like everybody else does, you'll get the same results that everybody else does.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Aortiz**: And so, like, when looking at that, you know, putting the ad and stuff out, right?
**Aortiz**: Like, so like, ask a better question, get a better answer.
**Jdawson**: Right, Right.
**Aortiz**: And so if you ask the question of, you know, how can I, you know, attract top tier talent, you know, and have a high conversion rate, something like that, right?
**Aortiz**: And start to ask that question.
**Aortiz**: This is where again, you can bounce ideas off AI, you know, you know, what can I do?
**Aortiz**: Because if we just put an ad out there like everybody else, right?
**Aortiz**: Then we're going to get the same results as everybody else.
**Aortiz**: And so it's like, how, you know, what do we have to do to attract, you know, that top Tier talent.
**Aortiz**: How do we go get that?
**Aortiz**: Like, a lot of that is going to be, you know, we have to go out and make contact, right?
**Aortiz**: Because, you know, if you think about it, right.
**Aortiz**: Like, I think about myself, like, before I, you know, started company, I never had to worry about getting a job, like, ever.
**Aortiz**: Like, I was recruited constantly, right.
**Aortiz**: If I ever wanted to leave, you know, I could go anywhere.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Aortiz**: And so those are the kind of people that we want to attract, those type A players, right?
**Aortiz**: Guys that really want to grow and they're smart and they, you know, like, you know, Mustangs run with Mustangs, right?
**Aortiz**: So we want to get, you know, those Mustangs because we don't want to take a mule, right, and try to pull them.
**Aortiz**: You know, we want to let Mustangs run, right?
**Jdawson**: And I noticed, like, right now I'm trying to make an Indeed posting.
**Jdawson**: I already created it.
**Jdawson**: I just haven't posted.
**Jdawson**: I need to review it with Jesse one more time.
**Jdawson**: But I do know Indeed isn't like, the best.
**Jdawson**: I feel like a lot of people on Indeed just like, go on Indeed and just like, click, click, click, click, click, click, and then wait for something when we want the best.
**Jdawson**: So I was thinking maybe, like, we could go on LinkedIn and create a job posting just because it's more extroverted, it's more out there and, like, people interact.
**Jdawson**: But I'll definitely do some research on, like, the best way we can make, like, a posting and where.
**Aortiz**: Yeah.
**Aortiz**: And remember.
**Aortiz**: Right.
**Aortiz**: Like, so if.
**Aortiz**: If we just have a posting out there, like, you know, sure, there's a chance that we might get really, you know, top player.
**Aortiz**: Like, but it's a lot lower versus there's other strategies to get top players.
**Aortiz**: Like, how do we, you know, how do we do that?
**Aortiz**: Because we.
**Aortiz**: If somebody does is not employed, it's automatically a disqualifier.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Aortiz**: You know, because in this economy, right.
**Aortiz**: Like, I mean, how many times, you know, when we hire somebody, we put an offer out there, and if they go turn in their two weeks and their.
**Aortiz**: Their employer says, well, you can just leave today.
**Aortiz**: Like, we're like, all right, well, you can start here immediately.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Aortiz**: You know, like, that's like, that's typically how it is.
**Aortiz**: Like, and so anybody who's unemployed and looking for something is a huge red flag.
**Aortiz**: Right?
**Aortiz**: Like, there's something like, why are you not.
**Aortiz**: Like, that's ridiculous.
**Aortiz**: Like, and, you know, why are you not employed?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Like, what are the faults?
**Aortiz**: Exactly.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Aortiz**: We don't need, you know, more headaches.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: So, okay.
**Jdawson**: Perfect.
**Aortiz**: So that's something I'll do.
**Jdawson**: I'll do my research on that.
**Aortiz**: And then whenever you.
**Aortiz**: That furniture can I need like a.
**Aortiz**: Probably like an end table or something.
**Aortiz**: And like, I'm pretty sure I ordered that coffee table for here, but just order another one.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I'll ask Maria about it.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah, sounds good.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And then don't forget the guy from the workers come finally.
**Bclymer**: He's just gonna call you on September.
**Bclymer**: I'll let you know.
**Bclymer**: Obviously, you already have it on your calendar.
**Bclymer**: But it's just a matter of he just want to know, like, what's the company the story, you know, if you.
**Bclymer**: Something like that.
**Bclymer**: So he can, you know, prove it from the Liberty Mutual that I don't.
**Bclymer**: And I was like, okay, perfect.
**Bclymer**: And other than that, that's it.
**Bclymer**: So you have a meeting right now.
**Bclymer**: I mean, 10 minutes.
**Bclymer**: So let me know what you need.
**Bclymer**: And then also Ashley is there.
**Bclymer**: Just let me know and thank you.
**Aortiz**: Thanks.
**Bclymer**: Bye, guys.
**Aortiz**: See you.
