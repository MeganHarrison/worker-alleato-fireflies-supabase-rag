## Transcript
**Jdawson**: Hey, Jesse.
**Speaker 1**: Hey, Jesse.
**Speaker 1**: How's it going?
**Jdawson**: Lovely.
**Jdawson**: Yourself?
**Speaker 1**: Good.
**Speaker 1**: Here in rainy Florida, man.
**Speaker 1**: The last three days.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, non stop.
**Jdawson**: Been hot as in sunny here.
**Speaker 1**: It's been raining there.
**Jdawson**: No, it's been hot and sunny.
**Jdawson**: I thought it was going to rain last night, but it didn't.
**Jdawson**: Pardon?
**Speaker 1**: Is that a new dog sitter you're using?
**Jdawson**: Which one?
**Jdawson**: The one I'm going out to right now.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, no, it's the same one.
**Speaker 1**: Same one.
**Speaker 1**: I gotcha.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: She lives out in the legit barren desert at an intersection known as Whitman.
**Speaker 1**: Right on.
**Speaker 1**: Well, how'd it go today with all the meetings?
**Jdawson**: Busy.
**Jdawson**: Thank you for catching sending that email to McCrae for Bloomington.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I'm assuming that was your doing.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I told him send that out today.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Speaker 1**: Since we got some precedence for their keeping.
**Speaker 1**: Keeping on with their delays because there's nothing stopping them now.
**Speaker 1**: They're just choosing to go somewhere else.
**Jdawson**: Oh, absolutely.
**Jdawson**: And they're using 10 o' clock like I said earlier as a buffer for them to buck off today and then show up there tomorrow morning.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: That guy obviously knows his way around notices too.
**Jdawson**: So he's clearly been threatened with a lot of them.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So I think we have a plan.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if you were on in the beginning of the meeting when we wrote out every activity and when we have it either scheduled or need it done by.
**Jdawson**: So we have.
**Speaker 1**: Wasn't able to join there, but that's good.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I just want to have a short list so Jack has something quick he can look at and know exactly what he needs.
**Jdawson**: And then it sounds like we push the inspection to Tuesday.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, seriously?
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So Monday's Labor Day.
**Jdawson**: I haven't heard back from those guys yet on if the change is confirmed, but we didn't want to risk pissing off the city with a last minute reschedule.
**Jdawson**: And if the client isn't moving in until the third, I think it's better to play it safe.
**Speaker 1**: I didn't even account for the Labor Day weekend, so we just gotta update.
**Speaker 1**: We'll have to update Andrew tomorrow, like after that thing's poured and then we know.
**Speaker 1**: Because as soon as that thing's poured.
**Speaker 1**: Put them fuckers on notice.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Should.
**Jdawson**: Should I expect to meet him?
**Jdawson**: Is he a pretty frequent flyer at the site?
**Speaker 1**: Should I meet him?
**Speaker 1**: Do what?
**Jdawson**: Is Andrew a pretty regular visitor of the site?
**Speaker 1**: He does.
**Speaker 1**: So you'll probably.
**Jdawson**: Good.
**Jdawson**: I wanted to meet him.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I need you to meet him so you can start being a person.
**Speaker 1**: Call him, let him know what's up, going on and stuff.
**Jdawson**: Okay, yeah, that'd be good if I could meet him.
**Speaker 1**: Good pizza.
**Speaker 1**: We got a lot of stuff in the works with them guys, so.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, Goodwill sounds like a very frequent name here, so.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that'll be good.
**Jdawson**: Is candid all right?
**Speaker 1**: You heard something going to the dentist here, you know they're gonna do some 3D x rays or some and then they probably have to have a root canal, so.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, last I talked to him, he just got sent away from the first dentist to the other dentist to go look at getting that root canal.
**Speaker 1**: Man, I'm glad.
**Speaker 1**: I don't like sweets and I don't like soda.
**Speaker 1**: So the two biggest problems.
**Jdawson**: He's got crowns on those, Steve.
**Speaker 1**: Really?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So I'm guessing he got him kicked out in basketball.
**Speaker 1**: Probably.
**Speaker 1**: He's their enforcer on the team, so.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I donated a few to hockey.
**Jdawson**: And then Ashley, I talked to her, she emailed me back this morning.
**Jdawson**: Morning.
**Jdawson**: She's putting together the PM posting, finalizing that and then she said she's looking into stronger options than indeed for posting it.
**Jdawson**: So the way we have that set up is I'll filter those resumes and I'll do first round interviews and then just give you the short list.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, good.
**Jdawson**: Should get good, good traffic on that.
**Speaker 1**: But.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, there's definitely a need.
**Jdawson**: Are those projects that Alec guy was working on, is Candon getting those things back to strong?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, he's.
**Speaker 1**: He's a big help in getting them done.
**Speaker 1**: And then when we have these other projects starting up, we just need someone that doesn't have get their handheld like someone we know.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And then Westfield and Andrew talked to that Waylon and the only way and the only way to get in touch with that finance department is via email.
**Jdawson**: So Waylon copied in some other manager at their end and Andrew's trying to get that ball moving.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, good.
**Jdawson**: And we should be looking good on the schedule.
**Jdawson**: We had that meeting this morning and Chad's figuring on just having those changes we made and updates by the end of the day.
**Speaker 1**: Well, I'm going through fixing all these.
**Speaker 1**: Job planner running this so it spits out our billings correctly.
**Speaker 1**: I gotta go in and change the Costco settings for every job.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, she emailed me back Friday.
**Jdawson**: Sorry, what's that?
**Speaker 1**: Well, it was combining everything, so gotta go in and just kind of relabel the fee, insurance and contingency and makes it show up.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I did get an email back from around pay apps late Friday and I haven't got a chance to read through it yet, but, yeah, I did glance at it, and it looked like a lot of it was the way we enter that stuff for the owner pay apps to get generated.
**Jdawson**: But there was a couple that she did say were bugs on there and that I think she said she fixed.
**Jdawson**: I have to go back and look at that email before I leave.
**Jdawson**: And then I got the punch list one loaded up for her.
**Jdawson**: And Glenn emailed her about the change orders printing, actually in order by division, not randomly like they were doing.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so they should be working on that, too.
**Jdawson**: And then for Fresno, I talked to Camden today.
**Jdawson**: And then the electrical fire alarm and H VAC numbers, were expecting those back by Wednesday.
**Jdawson**: And then I did email the roofer.
**Jdawson**: He's sending his pricing back.
**Jdawson**: He's going to look at it when he gets to the office today.
**Jdawson**: And I emailed the architect structural design for a tweak on their number for the new scope.
**Jdawson**: Then Candon's gonna get rid of the.
**Jdawson**: Get in touch with the other two or three subs.
**Speaker 1**: I think Brandon talked to Walter, the owner, today, so get that thing going.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I know.
**Jdawson**: I talked to him Friday.
**Jdawson**: I didn't know I talked to him today, but yeah, everything should be in the works.
**Jdawson**: And get the revised pricing.
**Jdawson**: And they just canceled that design coordination meeting for that Panettone, which is nice, because that's the meeting I had until I have to run out the door.
**Speaker 1**: What's Panatoni?
**Jdawson**: A tenant improvement project.
**Jdawson**: Harrisburg, I think.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I might be a few minutes late to the ops meeting, and I might lose it on the way out to that lady's house.
**Jdawson**: Okay, but my note is updated.
**Jdawson**: And then I messaged all the guys this morning to get their stuff updated before the meeting.
**Speaker 1**: Excellent.
**Speaker 1**: Well, are you going to be in the air during that meeting?
**Speaker 1**: I don't know what time that is.
**Jdawson**: No, no, that's.
**Jdawson**: I'm going to be just out away from my house on the way to that lady's house.
**Jdawson**: So I. I live right on the northwest edge of town and five minutes away from my house.
**Jdawson**: I'm out in the open desert on the way to her house and cell phone service is hit and miss out there.
**Speaker 1**: You getting in late?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I wanted to stay so I could work this morning.
**Speaker 1**: Right on, right on.
**Speaker 1**: Well, shit, I appreciate you going up there, man.
**Speaker 1**: That's a big help.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I know.
**Jdawson**: Nick's got his cat, so I would never want to be him have to leave with his cat in that shape.
**Speaker 1**: He took it to get surgery done today.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I knew it was going in, so.
**Jdawson**: God, he's got enough on his mind today without having to fly to Indiana.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Jdawson**: But thank you.
**Jdawson**: And I'll try to still make all the meetings I should be able to.
**Jdawson**: That's just like four plus hours of my day.
**Jdawson**: So it's going to be tight with trying to keep Jack lined out and all those subs going there, but I'll do the best I can.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I appreciate it.
**Jdawson**: Certainly.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: Well.
**Jdawson**: And then I guess.
**Jdawson**: Sorry, if.
**Jdawson**: What's that?
**Speaker 1**: If you need anything, let me know.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: If there's any meetings I know I'm not going to be able to make, I'll shoot you a text.
**Jdawson**: Just so you know, I'm not going to be on it because I don't know who's going to be coming there and where, when.
**Jdawson**: I'm going to have to meet with people and all that stuff, too.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, I'll circle back with you tomorrow morning.
**Jdawson**: Just let you know first thoughts are getting there and everything.
**Jdawson**: Cool.
**Jdawson**: Thank you.
**Speaker 1**: All right, thanks.
