## Transcript
**Jdawson**: SA.
**Speaker 1**: So just sending a meeting invite.
**Jdawson**: So what's going on in Bloomington?
**Speaker 1**: It sounds like we're gonna be good.
**Speaker 1**: So apparently he's.
**Speaker 1**: That concrete guy is doing good under the canopy.
**Speaker 1**: And the United guys went there.
**Speaker 1**: We're still waiting for their pricing.
**Speaker 1**: But he thinks that concrete Rick, that other concrete guy can get everything.
**Speaker 1**: And the only support we'll need from United is on the loading dock.
**Speaker 1**: So he's gonna.
**Jdawson**: For what.
**Speaker 1**: There'S trying to find.
**Speaker 1**: He put a bunch of pictures up because we got to get that closed in.
**Speaker 1**: So he's gonna have like a $200 change order or something to close in that opening so he can get the AC on so they can start getting their tile and everything down and let me find hibbit.
**Speaker 1**: So we got the scaffold.
**Speaker 1**: That change order is received.
**Speaker 1**: It's $2800 if we have to use it.
**Jdawson**: We have to do what now?
**Speaker 1**: If we have to move that scaffold.
**Jdawson**: Well, they're not done this week with the block.
**Speaker 1**: No, I believe they have to come back.
**Speaker 1**: They have to come back at the end of next week.
**Jdawson**: But they finished everything else with the block except putting the face blocking.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, that front area.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, that top.
**Speaker 1**: The top front area.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: He's got to pour that inside.
**Speaker 1**: And then we got that issue on the bottom.
**Speaker 1**: But once we hear back from United on the prize, we'll be able to fine tune the schedule for next week.
**Speaker 1**: And Andrew, we're sending him a schedule update.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Speaker 1**: Regardless, we have a meeting at 3:30 my time or your time with Jack and Nick to just catch up and make sure that we're all on the same page and staying on top of this stuff.
**Jdawson**: How big of those windows were?
**Speaker 1**: Which picture are you looking at?
**Speaker 1**: Oh, that block.
**Speaker 1**: Opening 1.
**Jdawson**: Thought they were much taller than that.
**Speaker 1**: The ones on the black wall.
**Speaker 1**: The new.
**Speaker 1**: Those ones.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I mean, what the.
**Jdawson**: What the.
**Jdawson**: They got to equal the square footage of what we took out.
**Speaker 1**: Those are the ones they had to put closing the tops though, aren't they?
**Speaker 1**: Wasn't this.
**Speaker 1**: That they had to.
**Jdawson**: Jesus Christ.
**Jdawson**: Do these look big enough?
**Jdawson**: Thought we had windows that were like.
**Jdawson**: They got to equal the square footage that we took out.
**Speaker 2**: You had asked if we could shorten them.
**Jdawson**: No, I.
**Jdawson**: They had to equal the square footage of what we took out.
**Speaker 2**: We did do that.
**Jdawson**: So that's what these do.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Because this looks a lot bigger than that.
**Speaker 2**: Well, we have.
**Speaker 2**: We have the vestibule glass.
**Jdawson**: Where's the dam?
**Speaker 2**: I remember we.
**Speaker 2**: We looked at that and I did take the square footage including the festive view.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, maybe I'm just that, that.
**Jdawson**: This picture.
**Jdawson**: Where's that drawing?
**Jdawson**: Where's the window drawings at?
**Speaker 2**: Go to honesty.
**Speaker 2**: The elevations of the current drawings folder.
**Jdawson**: And this.
**Jdawson**: I hope I'm just dreaming, but.
**Speaker 1**: We.
**Speaker 2**: We talked about.
**Jdawson**: Like that's what I mean.
**Jdawson**: Why are those that much higher?
**Speaker 2**: Well, we had six feet and then you asked me to see if we.
**Speaker 2**: We can shorten them and still meet the square footage so we would save money.
**Speaker 2**: And then that's what we.
**Jdawson**: Aren't they having to wrap this EFAs around the blick or they're.
**Jdawson**: They're planning on stopping with this funky little corner.
**Jdawson**: This.
**Jdawson**: They should have put dense glass all the way around.
**Jdawson**: I mean this should be a continuous band here.
**Jdawson**: Sure.
**Jdawson**: They could just tap kind of dense glass to there.
**Jdawson**: But that like he understands.
**Jdawson**: And you understand, right, Nick, that we got to bring this.
**Jdawson**: We can't just end this shit like that.
**Jdawson**: How in the world do we figure out that equal this?
**Jdawson**: Are you in agreement here, Nick?
**Jdawson**: You understand this like this has to come out around the corner.
**Jdawson**: So it's just one continuous band.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, I see that.
**Jdawson**: So while they got them, they're out there on a lift.
**Jdawson**: Make sure they just tack on their whatever to this so they got something to put the EFAs on.
**Jdawson**: I hope.
**Jdawson**: I. I want to see your square footage just like how you come up with that.
**Speaker 2**: I'll go back and see how I calculated.
**Speaker 1**: Have you seen what this looks like on the elevation?
**Jdawson**: This is what we sent to the city.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, that's the one I got open.
**Speaker 1**: Isn't that blue?
**Speaker 1**: The dens.
**Jdawson**: This was supposedly the size of the window.
**Jdawson**: These things here, these light blue.
**Jdawson**: This is all episode dense glass around it.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I'm looking at the bottom.
**Speaker 1**: That band underneath the windows where how it terminates under the window and doesn't go around the corner.
**Jdawson**: Well, the problem is the framing had to go back past this masonry column because the window's tight there and there's nothing to frame to.
**Jdawson**: And it's not.
**Jdawson**: There's just no way to frame these windows and without knocking that out.
**Jdawson**: So now we gotta come across with EFAs.
**Jdawson**: You know, we're just gonna have to run continuous.
**Jdawson**: And that was the point of, you know, that's why it'll be a continuous band here.
**Speaker 1**: Gotcha.
**Jdawson**: I'm just trying to like, when they look at that like now they're.
**Jdawson**: It's going to look significantly smaller.
**Speaker 1**: You sawed them off.
**Speaker 1**: They look about half sawed off.
**Speaker 1**: They go just A few inches above that.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, right there.
**Jdawson**: That's all we have anyways.
**Speaker 1**: I was just trying to scale it.
**Speaker 1**: What's that?
**Jdawson**: What else is happening?
**Speaker 1**: Trying to get that PSR SOP sent to you today at the usual.
**Speaker 1**: I've been in meetings pretty much all day around the phone.
**Speaker 1**: Brandon changed up the Fresno stuff a little bit to we're getting that requoted to be eight 70 ton units to go replace the existing 25 tons.
**Speaker 1**: So that's in the works.
**Speaker 1**: The pricing is due back on Wednesday from the H VAC and electrical.
**Speaker 1**: And then Camden and jremillard meeting up early next week to go through everything.
**Speaker 1**: And then I, I told those guys we need to plan to have all the bids in finalized contracts drafted as much as we can by Friday the 5th.
**Speaker 1**: The kind of time with that two week window for the response on the license.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, I haven't.
**Jdawson**: Not heard.
**Speaker 1**: And Mike sounds like he's on, on top of it down there.
**Speaker 1**: He's progressively gotten a lot better, I've noticed in the time I've been working with him.
**Jdawson**: Who's that?
**Speaker 1**: Mike.
**Jdawson**: Okay, that's good.
**Speaker 1**: I mean it's a, it's a small project but it's a great one for him to learn on.
**Speaker 1**: And I got him, I told him just take the shit out of pictures of everything and learn everything he can about this stuff and the way it works.
**Speaker 1**: So Keba's out today I guess.
**Speaker 1**: But he's working on the broken out pricing of that.
**Speaker 1**: Oh that change order to exotech.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: But yeah, this is a big one watching this stuff to make sure it stays on course because that's, it's so tight right now.
**Speaker 1**: They have everything, the schedule wise, all the inspections and tcos and shit end of next week.
**Speaker 1**: But Jack has really put it in today, you know, yesterday he started communicating a lot more and telling us what we need to know.
**Speaker 1**: And we're working on everything together.
**Speaker 1**: And it's coming together in that aspect really good.
**Speaker 1**: So just keeping him on it is the important part.
**Jdawson**: So we just arbitrarily get rid of this other bollard or what happened.
**Speaker 1**: Which bollard?
**Jdawson**: One on the other side of the column.
**Speaker 1**: Let me find it out.
**Speaker 1**: Because it looks like they're still drilling it in and in process of these pictures being taken because they got three around the next one.
**Jdawson**: Oh, that's the ones they're drilling in?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's drilling through the stone.
**Speaker 1**: That Rick guy is kind of a hot mess with coordinating everything right now.
**Speaker 1**: But just he's there and he's doing shit.
**Speaker 1**: And it sounds like it's going the way we would want it to.
**Speaker 1**: Except for his guy taking the electrician's excavator key home.
**Jdawson**: Oh no.
**Jdawson**: Where's home?
**Speaker 1**: Local guy.
**Speaker 1**: They just didn't come back to site or something.
**Speaker 1**: But it's a cat so they can just get any key.
**Speaker 1**: And then do you know about that back charge that's going to be happening to the concrete guy for hitting that conduit to the light pole.
**Jdawson**: Oh, what happened?
**Speaker 1**: Digging right over.
**Speaker 1**: He hit a conduit going out to one of the light poles.
**Speaker 1**: So Jack had him fix it tni t m and he's given that pricing today from them.
**Speaker 1**: They finished it up and everything should be fine on it.
**Speaker 1**: And we'll back charge that to the concrete guy.
**Speaker 1**: And he was there.
**Speaker 1**: He wasn't happy but it's taken care of.
**Speaker 1**: And then there's going to be that other little internal change order for that closing in that loading dock.
**Speaker 1**: And then we got the water fountain and the vault change order and Nick's got that subcontract for the vault work from United.
**Speaker 1**: And then we got a couple other change orders out and then keep the SC fab to make sure we get them timed right.
**Speaker 1**: And we should start seeing a lot more pictures in here.
**Speaker 1**: Ashley's going to be getting back to me today so we can review that job posting quick for the soup in Indy.
**Jdawson**: And are you doing.
**Jdawson**: Are you doing one for a PM as well?
**Speaker 1**: Brandy, we can.
**Jdawson**: We need to.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 1**: It's just a matter of dropping the other role description.
**Speaker 1**: And I also got a response back from the job planner lady on the pay apps.
**Speaker 1**: I just haven't had a chance to read through it yet and then I have an email loaded up for her on the punch list.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, other than that it's not very exciting.
**Speaker 1**: I'm feeling better.
**Speaker 1**: So I kind of sat here a little too long last night I think.
**Speaker 1**: But it was nice.
**Speaker 1**: And my last frickin pill today.
**Speaker 1**: Holy shit.
**Speaker 1**: Do those things tear your insides up when you make you feel better?
**Speaker 1**: At least I think that's what it was.
**Jdawson**: Being done with the pills.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, this morning was the last one I had to take but man those things kind of sent me for an interesting ride.
**Speaker 1**: My knees hurt so bad it was hard to bend.
**Speaker 1**: Bend them.
**Speaker 1**: I was walking around straight legged.
**Jdawson**: You're basically you feeling everything's back to normal.
**Speaker 1**: Well I'm just back to the usual dizzy and nauseous.
**Speaker 1**: But I can feel my eyes getting better from the they're doing.
**Speaker 1**: She actually milked them when I was there on Monday and.
**Jdawson**: I felt oil.
**Speaker 1**: On my eyes for the first time in a while.
**Speaker 1**: When I go to the.
**Speaker 1**: Not next week but the following Friday I go to that cancer doctor.
**Jdawson**: That's why they're supposed to give you the results of your.
**Jdawson**: All the test they've taken.
**Speaker 1**: No, actually it's.
**Speaker 1**: I got an email on.
**Speaker 1**: On a Sunday night and it was the report from the original visit I went to a few weeks ago where he told me I had it and that's the actual like that's the diagnosis.
**Speaker 1**: So the.
**Speaker 1**: The blood oncologist guy for the blood stuff.
**Speaker 1**: I don't know what they're going to do.
**Speaker 1**: That's all incoming but I think it's just to determine which type I have and if it's a bone marrow biopsy I'm not doing it.
**Speaker 1**: Does it don't really make a difference which one I have ultimately.
**Speaker 1**: But even the eye doctor had one of those bone biopsies and she said it was miserable.
**Speaker 1**: Is there any news Paradise Isle?
**Jdawson**: Nothing really.
**Jdawson**: Just waiting probably in the next week, the following week to find out.
**Speaker 1**: And that Roebling Homes.
**Speaker 1**: I was thinking about that as there's no HOAs around that that are going to be a problem, is there?
**Jdawson**: They're going to make it into an hoa.
**Speaker 1**: Oh but there's none existing in that area.
**Jdawson**: It's just a small town.
**Jdawson**: So it's all the.
**Jdawson**: Oh here in Florida the neighbors can complain and sway public opinion.
**Jdawson**: All this fire alarm stuff.
**Jdawson**: This Jack's like what is our schedule for like why is that still that way?
**Speaker 1**: I'll check with them on it.
**Speaker 1**: I haven't had a chance to look through all these from yesterday and today yet.
**Jdawson**: This is yesterday.
**Jdawson**: This mason is slow.
**Jdawson**: Holy.
**Jdawson**: This is yesterday.
**Jdawson**: Hasn't done anything above the beam.
**Speaker 1**: Thank you for helping get this old stuff caught up too.
**Speaker 1**: This is super helpful.
**Jdawson**: Oh, which things you talked about like these.
**Speaker 1**: These issues that are coming to a head now that have been ongoing, you know, like this whole situation.
**Speaker 1**: Like I just got into this one the.
**Speaker 1**: With the footing issue of the canopy.
**Jdawson**: And I hope they don't say anything.
**Speaker 1**: About those windows.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I think you can sell it on the thickness of the wall above it.
**Speaker 1**: It's a shadow line that doesn't show on the drawings because I mean if you zoom out on that elevation it doesn't look terribly far off when you picture that EFAs being wrapped up.
**Jdawson**: I guess on this side.
**Jdawson**: This was the original opening but we were gaining square Footage on this side is.
**Jdawson**: Now we're not.
**Jdawson**: And this side.
**Jdawson**: These were.
**Jdawson**: This was full height.
**Jdawson**: These were half.
**Speaker 1**: On this side.
**Speaker 1**: This.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, that's why they're half.
**Jdawson**: Well, these were taller because he had steps up.
**Jdawson**: This was a shorter oval.
**Jdawson**: These needed to be bigger.
**Jdawson**: I don't know.
**Jdawson**: Is it me?
**Jdawson**: Like, when I look at this, that does not look like five feet.
**Speaker 1**: You're freezing up.
**Speaker 1**: Try turning your camera off.
**Jdawson**: I just don't know what these openings were supposed to be.
**Speaker 1**: Like.
**Speaker 1**: The square footage.
**Jdawson**: Oh, no.
**Jdawson**: The height.
**Speaker 1**: Oh.
**Jdawson**: Sa.
**Speaker 1**: See if I can.
**Jdawson**: Remember.
**Speaker 2**: What we did now with those windows is where we tried to keep the same square footage up to elevations that were approved because the windows on the elevations were smaller than the windows that were shorter than the windows that we installed.
**Speaker 2**: That's what we did.
**Jdawson**: That don't make any sense.
**Jdawson**: So what do we do here?
**Jdawson**: I'll open this drawing up.
**Speaker 2**: We try to match.
**Speaker 2**: Match the square footage of the windows that are on this elevation.
**Jdawson**: That doesn't make any sense.
**Jdawson**: So the city said, you took out this many square foot of window.
**Jdawson**: You got to add back that to the facade.
**Jdawson**: And somehow we calculated it so that we'd have enough window.
**Jdawson**: Like, this side didn't need as much as this side.
**Jdawson**: But between the two of them, we were over the required square footage because this.
**Jdawson**: That was the difference on this side.
**Jdawson**: Like, these existing ones were only this tall.
**Jdawson**: But then you come around to this side, and they were, like, much taller because the elevation dropped.
**Jdawson**: These went down lower, so we were closer.
**Jdawson**: A little short over here, and we over over here.
**Jdawson**: But what are you telling me, Nick?
**Jdawson**: We don't have enough square footage to match the existing that we took out.
**Speaker 2**: Just remember we.
**Speaker 2**: We quoted it.
**Speaker 2**: We took the square footage off of these elevations, and then we found out the windows are actually wider than are shown on this elevation.
**Jdawson**: What do you mean, wider?
**Speaker 1**: It's.
**Speaker 2**: This elevation is not scaled properly.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so you physically measured.
**Jdawson**: You had.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, you had.
**Jdawson**: But here's what I'm saying.
**Jdawson**: Like.
**Jdawson**: Like.
**Jdawson**: So here's a window, and it's this big.
**Jdawson**: It's this tall.
**Jdawson**: And here's what we were supposed to replace the square footage of not even close.
**Jdawson**: Now we're way under on this side.
**Jdawson**: Now you go to this side.
**Speaker 1**: And.
**Jdawson**: It'S even worse because it's even bigger.
**Jdawson**: Like, we're not even close.
**Jdawson**: And I thought we got five foot by whatever windows.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, they're supposed to be five feet.
**Jdawson**: Well, there's no way that's five feet.
**Jdawson**: I mean, unless this guy like what is.
**Jdawson**: Is this guy four feet tall?
**Jdawson**: Is he.
**Speaker 2**: The blocks are eight inches.
**Speaker 2**: So we could scale it off blue.
**Jdawson**: Well that's did the framer up and frame them too short.
**Jdawson**: And then we made these.
**Jdawson**: We had the windows the right size and we cut the windows down.
**Jdawson**: I mean.
**Speaker 2**: Try to scale it on blue vision.
**Jdawson**: Well 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
**Jdawson**: Seven block.
**Jdawson**: Be like little over seven block.
**Jdawson**: But we don't think we ever get a shop drawing from this window guy.
**Jdawson**: And what we used.
**Jdawson**: What did the framer frame his openings.
**Speaker 2**: Off of dimensions we gave him.
**Speaker 2**: We met.
**Speaker 2**: We gave him five foot high dimensions and we gave him the width.
**Speaker 2**: We gave the window guy and the framer the same opening dimension.
**Jdawson**: I mean maybe it's five foot.
**Jdawson**: The dude short.
**Speaker 1**: This the elevation on Bluebeam I just pulled off the door and it comes out.
**Speaker 1**: Those are 8 foot high, 12 foot wide windows.
**Jdawson**: The existing ones.
**Speaker 1**: The ones on the elevation.
**Jdawson**: Well we knew they were not correct the size on that.
**Jdawson**: But like what is this?
**Jdawson**: So nobody knows what windows out there other than Jack and a tape measure.
**Speaker 2**: They're supposed to be 5ft tall.
**Jdawson**: SA.
**Speaker 1**: Just generically scaling that drawing off a block.
**Speaker 1**: They're 2 1/2ft tall and 10ft wide.
**Jdawson**: Oh, that can't be right.
**Speaker 1**: Let me see if there's a straight on picture.
**Jdawson**: Sa things look a lot like four feet.
**Jdawson**: That's six courses of lock.
**Jdawson**: Four feet.
**Jdawson**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
**Jdawson**: So I would imagine they built us more than four feet.
**Jdawson**: Like what the did they build us?
**Jdawson**: And we cut them down is it.
**Jdawson**: They cut them down because this didn't frame his window opening five foot.
**Jdawson**: Can we get Jack on this call.
**Speaker 2**: If you try to scale on the other side because it could be scaling thing.
**Jdawson**: Nick, four foot a block is four foot a block no matter what.
**Jdawson**: Typically it's the depth of the of you away from something that starts to with the precision.
**Jdawson**: But just thinking of that like.
**Jdawson**: Like this here opening the thing six feet.
**Jdawson**: That's six feet.
**Jdawson**: Six feet eight.
**Jdawson**: Hey Jack.
**Jdawson**: Hey.
**Jdawson**: What size are the windows that are currently in this building now the ones that we added.
**Speaker 3**: We shrinking look on those.
**Speaker 3**: They're originally supposed to be 6ft and then we shortened them to 5ft.
**Jdawson**: What are the windows that are installed today?
**Speaker 3**: They're the not those original 6ft ones.
**Jdawson**: Do you have a tape measure?
**Speaker 3**: Yes.
**Speaker 3**: I'm walking over there now with my tape measure.
**Speaker 1**: Just give me a couple seconds and I'll exactly.
**Speaker 3**: Why?
**Speaker 3**: What's going on?
**Jdawson**: Nobody knows how big our windows are because we never Got shop drawings and like, I don't know what the going on, but I just would like to know what are the size of these window openings?
**Jdawson**: Because I think we're now with the city.
**Jdawson**: Because these things are too small.
**Jdawson**: I can't really see.
**Speaker 3**: Let me get in this lift real quick.
**Jdawson**: Do you know the address of this job site.
**Speaker 1**: That.
**Speaker 3**: All right, what were you asking about the address?
**Jdawson**: What is the job site address there?
**Speaker 3**: 2817 E. 3rd St.
**Speaker 3**: But I mean, that's the address I use.
**Speaker 3**: We are exactly at 4 foot 7.
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Jdawson**: We shrunk down the windows because the frame.
**Jdawson**: Like, how in the.
**Jdawson**: Did the framer frame these things too small?
**Jdawson**: And then we convinced the window guy to cut down his windows because our framer didn't frame these things big enough.
**Jdawson**: Now we made our problem worse with the city.
**Jdawson**: What the.
**Jdawson**: What in the.
**Jdawson**: I went to take a pitch.
**Jdawson**: Does anyone have an answer for me how that happened?
**Speaker 3**: I'm looking into it.
**Speaker 1**: So I get back to my desk.
**Jdawson**: And this is a major cluster.
**Jdawson**: If the city doesn't buy into these things and we.
**Jdawson**: I mean, holy.
**Jdawson**: The window guy is going to hit this guy with the change order for the framer now.
**Jdawson**: And none of it's going to matter if the city says, we.
**Jdawson**: We don't got nearly enough square feet now and we gotta rip these out on our dime.
**Jdawson**: Now we're going to be paying for.
**Speaker 1**: This.
**Jdawson**: To make these windows bigger.
**Jdawson**: That's a giant bunch of money that that's going to.
**Jdawson**: And I'm just here a little bit in shock that the window guy.
**Jdawson**: We told him he has to be 5 foot by this foot.
**Jdawson**: Did he not say, that's exactly what I made him.
**Jdawson**: What direction was given to this framer that he framed these in shorter?
**Jdawson**: And then the window guy just bends over and says, oh, I guess I'll just cut all my down.
**Speaker 3**: The city was not expecting 6ft.
**Speaker 3**: Right.
**Speaker 3**: They were just expecting at least 5ft.
**Jdawson**: Expected the amount of glass we took out to be replaced on an elevation of the building.
**Jdawson**: So we had to replace the square footage at the block openings, which you're supposed to go out and measure for us and then add in the vestibule.
**Jdawson**: And that's what we had to provide.
**Jdawson**: Where's the direction to everyone about what size to make these?
**Jdawson**: As Glenn Mark said, you need to make these five foot, whatever, rough opening by.
**Jdawson**: With this rough opening?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: So east.
**Speaker 3**: I'm looking at the change order right now.
**Speaker 3**: It says east elevation openings, two openings will be framed at 5ft in height by 152 and 3/4.
**Speaker 3**: One opening will be framed at 5ft in height, 1310 and a half south elevation openings.
**Speaker 3**: Two openings will be framed at 5ft IN height, 22ft and half inch in width.
**Jdawson**: So when the window guy shows up, why don't we tell Glenmark you fucked up These openings, they're supposed to be 5 foot.
**Jdawson**: We tell the window guy he fucked up and now he's got to cut down his five foot windows to fit in the opening Glenmark did.
**Speaker 3**: His windows were actually six feet.
**Speaker 3**: Because originally when Nick and the window guy were talking.
**Jdawson**: Why are our openings framed into 4 foot 7 now?
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, they, they shorted him.
**Jdawson**: Well, they shorted him, they shorted us.
**Jdawson**: Now we're below the required square footage.
**Speaker 3**: Is, is, is 5ft in height even below the square footage as well?
**Speaker 3**: Or was five feet measured?
**Jdawson**: Those openings that we were replacing, what size were they?
**Jdawson**: I mean all that square footage was.
**Speaker 3**: I was only asked to measure.
**Speaker 3**: I was only asked the measurement from left to right, not from the height.
**Speaker 3**: And originally it was a lot of verbal conversations with diamond glass between Nick and that guy when they were saying six feet.
**Speaker 3**: But then Nick said in an email and documentation for him to be 5 foot windows in height.
**Speaker 3**: Well, the guy admitted to Nick that he made a mistake and that he just went off of verbal conversations and made 6 foot height and windows.
**Speaker 3**: So then he said, we will then remake them as fast as possible so we don't delay y'.
**Speaker 3**: All.
**Speaker 3**: Sorry for the mistake, but at the.
**Jdawson**: Time they framed them in wrong, they would had to change the framing anyways.
**Jdawson**: We could have just said, no, you need to make them six feet now.
**Jdawson**: Then at least we're covered with the city.
**Jdawson**: But now, I mean, done.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, reworked the windows and now we're probably too small.
**Speaker 1**: One sec.
**Jdawson**: Hey, Jesse.
**Speaker 3**: Jesse.
**Speaker 3**: That measurement I gave you was an exact measurement, not including the frame for the window.
**Speaker 3**: So this opening is exactly at 4 foot 11, but just the glass itself is at 4 foot 7 to account for the framing on top and bottom.
**Speaker 3**: I'm on the lift right now.
**Speaker 3**: When I first gave you that first measurement, I was thinking just specifically the glass, the window itself.
**Jdawson**: 4 foot 11.
**Jdawson**: We needed a 5 foot rough opening.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: So they, they, I mean, they still shorted.
**Jdawson**: You're telling me this.
**Jdawson**: The opening where the window is sticking in is five foot tall?
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: From drywall to drywall is exactly four foot eleven.
**Jdawson**: So the rough opening is five foot?
**Speaker 3**: Yep.
**Speaker 3**: And that's what's on the change order.
**Jdawson**: So these are five foot overall windows.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Well, maybe I'm upset over nothing.
**Jdawson**: Is this.
**Jdawson**: This square footage plus the vestibule equal what we needed.
**Jdawson**: Like, what's the height of these existing masonry openings?
**Jdawson**: I mean, these others on this other side are.
**Jdawson**: Are much bigger.
**Jdawson**: I mean, these don't equal this.
**Speaker 3**: No, not at all.
**Speaker 3**: But that.
**Speaker 3**: That wasn't.
**Speaker 3**: I never.
**Speaker 3**: I was never asked to measurement for exactly from in height of what that opening is.
**Speaker 3**: It was just from width of the CMU block.
**Speaker 3**: The width of the opening.
**Jdawson**: Okay, Jack, it's not your fault.
**Speaker 3**: I'm coming back down.
**Speaker 2**: Can I share my screen and tell you what?
**Speaker 2**: I remember how we ordered these.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Speaker 2**: Originally we scaled or I scaled this and sent it to Diamond Glass to quote.
**Speaker 2**: And then we got the quote.
**Speaker 2**: And then I had Jack go and measure it in the field to make sure that this is accurate.
**Speaker 2**: And then we found out that the width was a lot more than is shown on these elevations.
**Speaker 2**: Like the actual width in the field.
**Speaker 2**: So then we asked them to re.
**Speaker 2**: Quote.
**Speaker 2**: They came back and the quote was higher.
**Speaker 2**: And I thought I had gone to you, Jesse, and you asked if we could still maintain the same.
**Speaker 2**: Or maybe I'm misunderstood, but I was trying to maintain the same square footage as is on the approved elevations.
**Speaker 2**: So because these are potentially wider in the field, we.
**Speaker 2**: We went down to 5ft to maintain that square footage that is on these drawings.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, but if the top gets bigger than the bottom.
**Jdawson**: Just got bigger.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Oh, boy.
**Speaker 3**: The measurement on the.
**Speaker 3**: On the height of the CME block that we infilled is 7 foot 11.
**Jdawson**: Well, at this point, if we have to add anything, we're going to add another window on top of these windows.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Well, let's hope they look out at it out of their.
**Jdawson**: Their bad eye, I guess.
**Jdawson**: I don't know.
**Jdawson**: Holy cluster.
**Jdawson**: Was this opening over here ever.
**Speaker 2**: Can see your screen.
**Jdawson**: So this one was always block?
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Can you share your screen, Jesse?
**Jdawson**: No.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Was this one here at the very end always block?
**Jdawson**: We only infilled these.
**Speaker 2**: All four were glass.
**Jdawson**: This was glass, too.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: We just figured we didn't need that one.
**Speaker 2**: Goodwill sign.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, because the goodwill sign.
**Speaker 2**: We had that meeting right before we met with the city where we got rid of that window because Andrew didn't want it.
**Jdawson**: Oh, because of their sign.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: I really thought me and you.
**Speaker 2**: You met Jesse and we.
**Speaker 2**: We were just trying to meet the square footage of what was on the drawings.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I know.
**Jdawson**: We should have thought about the fact if this.
**Jdawson**: This number's off because this got wider than that would have increased the requirement, you know.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: That's just like on these future jobs, I really.
**Jdawson**: We got to have the architect do these things.
**Jdawson**: We're putting too much on ourselves to not like be able to just spend the time to confirm all this, you know.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Have they decided on these awnings?
**Jdawson**: What are we doing with the awnings?
**Speaker 3**: I.
**Speaker 2**: I requested pricing from Glenmark.
**Speaker 2**: I met with the awning designer this week to figure out what he needed as far as attachments at the front for the cantilevered awnings.
**Jdawson**: And.
**Speaker 2**: Glenmark is gonna the price putting three by blocking or three, three layers of two by blocking underneath the Goodwill sign at the front entrance.
**Jdawson**: And everything else is ready to go.
**Speaker 2**: That's.
**Jdawson**: When I talk.
**Speaker 2**: When I talk to the awning designer this week, he said we're gonna have to cut the drywall again so he can attach a nut on the back of the rod that he.
**Speaker 2**: He's gonna use to attach the cantilever awnings.
**Jdawson**: So down here he's got a tear take off drywall.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: To get.
**Speaker 2**: So he.
**Speaker 2**: He's gonna have a rod with a nut on the back and he's gonna have to cut the drywall.
**Speaker 2**: So.
**Jdawson**: But does he realize there's a solid tube steel beam running through here?
**Speaker 2**: I think we.
**Speaker 2**: We talked about that.
**Speaker 2**: We didn't want to attach to the beam to not mess with the integrity of it.
**Speaker 2**: I remember me, you and Jack were talking about that.
**Speaker 2**: So we installed two by two layers.
**Jdawson**: Of two by blocking in the front of this.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: In between the window and the steel that's currently in the wall.
**Jdawson**: Do you have pictures of this?
**Jdawson**: J.
**Speaker 3**: The blocking that went on top of the tube still?
**Jdawson**: The blocking is behind all this sheathing.
**Speaker 1**: I.
**Speaker 2**: They have to open up the drywall anyways.
**Jdawson**: I mean, isn't there blocking out here somewhere?
**Speaker 2**: It's.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Directly underneath the windows.
**Jdawson**: So they shot wood blocking to the top of this steel beam.
**Jdawson**: Three layers of.
**Speaker 2**: There's two layers on this.
**Speaker 3**: So that gives it for him to be able to tie in at the top.
**Speaker 3**: And then he'll use the tube steel to tie in at the bottom.
**Speaker 3**: If this is a awning that has a back to it that's a foot in length.
**Speaker 2**: They said the two by six would.
**Speaker 2**: Would work for an attachment so he doesn't need to attach to the steel.
**Jdawson**: What does this blocking look like?
**Jdawson**: Is it.
**Jdawson**: There's a piece of tube steel running across here and then on top of that is setting one two by four by whatever and another two by four by whatever.
**Jdawson**: So is Three and a half inches high by the width of the wall.
**Speaker 2**: There's about 7 inches between the bottom of the window framing and the top of the tube steel.
**Speaker 2**: And we have two by six blocking that space.
**Jdawson**: So six inch up and down.
**Speaker 2**: Yes.
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: So he's drilling through that and then bolting to the backside of it.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: Supposed to have EFIS patch there this weekend.
**Jdawson**: Well, that's the other thing.
**Jdawson**: They didn't run this dense glass around the corner.
**Jdawson**: How they gonna.
**Jdawson**: What are they attaching the eepas to around this corner?
**Jdawson**: They just haven't done it yet.
**Speaker 3**: They just haven't done it.
**Jdawson**: Well, let's keep our fingers crossed the city doesn't notice it.
**Jdawson**: Or maybe they don't care because we put windows in.
**Jdawson**: I don't know.
**Speaker 2**: And even if we had six foot high windows, I don't think it would match the square footage because we got rid of that one window.
**Speaker 3**: True.
**Jdawson**: They look nice.
**Jdawson**: There's that.
**Jdawson**: Jesse, you're awful silent.
**Jdawson**: What do you think?
**Speaker 1**: I think the yellow really makes them fit right in.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Haven't changed the speech of dens glass.
**Jdawson**: It's upside down.
**Speaker 1**: So do we kind of need to be prepared for anything to answer to on this when we get our tco?
**Jdawson**: Probably.
**Jdawson**: Possibly.
**Jdawson**: Because they're gonna, I mean again, put on the TCO that.
**Jdawson**: Hey, we haven't finished the awnings yet because they're being manufactured or something.
**Jdawson**: And I just hate we did something different than what we submitted.
**Jdawson**: What did we submit for the drawing revision?
**Jdawson**: Did we have them Change it to 5 foot?
**Speaker 2**: We submitted those.
**Speaker 2**: Those drawings that I shared.
**Jdawson**: So we submitted them being taller.
**Speaker 2**: Taller and less wide.
**Speaker 1**: Looks better.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it's true.
**Speaker 1**: Or taller and wider.
**Speaker 1**: Or shorter.
**Speaker 1**: Sorry.
**Jdawson**: All right, well, talking about it ain't going to change anything now, so we just hope it's acceptable.
**Jdawson**: If not, we're going to be.
**Jdawson**: We would have to add a whole new one up here.
**Speaker 1**: Like a transom.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: We'll pre game before this inspection walk too.
**Speaker 1**: Jack.
**Speaker 1**: Awesome.
**Speaker 3**: I do have it on schedule with.
**Speaker 1**: The city, so it's good to go.
**Speaker 3**: For next week as far as.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: We got our meet.
**Speaker 1**: Our next meeting today coming up in the half hour.
**Speaker 1**: So we'll go through all that stuff.
**Speaker 2**: It's in full.
**Speaker 2**: Just have to say as little as possible.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, less is more with the city.
**Jdawson**: I was just saying we don't have the arming cell yet.
**Jdawson**: That's why we need a tco.
**Jdawson**: This picture from yesterday.
**Jdawson**: Did the block masons get any more of this done?
**Jdawson**: They don't have anything done above the beam?
**Speaker 3**: Yes, they have more done today.
**Jdawson**: Do they?
**Jdawson**: Like, set a block and then stand back, take a picture of it, shake hands with each other, and then start putting in another block.
**Jdawson**: Holy shit.
**Jdawson**: Talking about slow.
**Speaker 1**: Can you pull up that fire alarm warrior picture before we get off this call too, Jesse?
**Speaker 1**: Which one?
**Speaker 3**: Right now?
**Speaker 1**: The fire alarm picture.
**Speaker 1**: The wires?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Like, why are we.
**Jdawson**: Like, what is this for?
**Speaker 3**: They're still working on it.
**Jdawson**: So when are they done with fire alarm?
**Speaker 3**: They told me that they'll be done by the 27th and be ready to go for a meeting on the 28th.
**Speaker 2**: Have they tested the fire sprinkler?
**Speaker 3**: It's live.
**Speaker 1**: There's water.
**Speaker 3**: There's water on it.
**Speaker 1**: Have these guys been good so far, being there and getting stuff done on time?
**Speaker 1**: The fire guys, alarm guys?
**Speaker 3**: Which.
**Speaker 3**: Which guys?
**Speaker 1**: The fire alarm guys.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: I mean, they've.
**Speaker 3**: They've been very community high communication with us.
**Speaker 3**: They're very confident about where they're at.
**Speaker 3**: They've Their head project manager and the guy above that has came out to the site and visited multiple times to check up with me and inform me on how they're.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, it's a goodwill sub.
**Jdawson**: Are these like.
**Jdawson**: This is H vac.
**Jdawson**: They haven't flexed in yet.
**Jdawson**: Or is that all done now?
**Speaker 3**: Say that again.
**Jdawson**: I mean, this H Vac, if they.
**Jdawson**: There's no ceiling diffuser.
**Jdawson**: Like, is that all done?
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, he's told me he's all done.
**Jdawson**: I mean, this picture was yesterday, and I don't.
**Jdawson**: I see it.
**Jdawson**: Something coming off of the duct.
**Jdawson**: But is it just out of the picture?
**Jdawson**: Like, where's the diffuser in this room?
**Speaker 3**: It's out of the picture.
**Speaker 3**: It's a little bit.
**Jdawson**: Like.
**Jdawson**: This is.
**Jdawson**: I mean, why we got it.
**Jdawson**: Is that a return grill?
**Jdawson**: Jesse, how are you doing?
**Jdawson**: Good.
**Jdawson**: What's up?
**Jdawson**: I was gonna ask if you need help with anything.
**Jdawson**: No, I just need to finish this meeting up.
**Jdawson**: Okay, sounds good.
**Jdawson**: And I would walk that site with your plans today, Jack, and make sure there's completely understand what's left to be done.
**Jdawson**: You can fire off emails or make the calls about wrapping all this up next week.
**Speaker 1**: Gotcha.
**Jdawson**: When are they polishing this concrete?
**Jdawson**: After the floor is poured back?
**Speaker 3**: Yes, after the floor is poured back.
**Speaker 1**: At the dock door, they said.
**Jdawson**: Are these lockers movable?
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, they're not anchored in place right now.
**Speaker 3**: I'm standing right next to them.
**Jdawson**: Do we have final cleaning people coming in?
**Speaker 3**: Yes, they're scheduled for Thursday the 28th.
**Jdawson**: During your final Inspection?
**Speaker 3**: What's that?
**Jdawson**: The day of your inspection.
**Speaker 3**: That's the only day that they could give me next week unless.
**Speaker 3**: And Goodwill wants to move in as early as the weekend after my final inspection.
**Speaker 3**: Inspection.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: He said that's the best I could do, and that's the most.
**Speaker 3**: I really want to be flexible with the Lido group, I guess, due to some.
**Speaker 3**: Some disagreements on another job site.
**Speaker 1**: I don't.
**Speaker 3**: I don't know all the details, though.
**Jdawson**: So what now?
**Speaker 3**: He voiced very lightly some frustration that he's had on some other job sites.
**Jdawson**: With alleatogroup as far as moving in.
**Speaker 3**: As far as cleaning situation, something at Goodwill Foundations, and then something with Glenn about the wrong square footage.
**Jdawson**: Oh, your cleaning sub.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Paid him for it.
**Jdawson**: I just don't like.
**Jdawson**: But what's aggravating to him is he keeps getting brought in when we're not ready for final clean.
**Jdawson**: So if you got a bunch of construction going on and he can't come in and clean and there's all over the place, that's what gets him upset.
**Speaker 3**: Gotcha.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, he did.
**Speaker 3**: He did.
**Speaker 3**: He did end up asking me several times, are you sure no one's going to be in there working while I'm cleaning?
**Jdawson**: So this is what this looks like today.
**Speaker 1**: What shirt?
**Speaker 3**: When you said this.
**Speaker 3**: I'm looking at your cursor again.
**Speaker 3**: Yes, that's where that.
**Speaker 3**: That's what that looks like today.
**Jdawson**: And how is this getting wrapped up by next week?
**Speaker 3**: United excavation coming in and saving the day.
**Speaker 2**: That's the only way.
**Speaker 2**: Only way we're gonna be able to get that done.
**Speaker 2**: So he.
**Speaker 2**: He still hasn't got back to me today.
**Speaker 1**: Have you been hounding him?
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, I've been talking to him throughout the day.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, I think he just doesn't have an answer yet.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, because he's waiting on this concrete guy, right?
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So what's Merritt doing currently?
**Jdawson**: Nothing.
**Speaker 3**: McRae and Sons is prepping.
**Speaker 3**: They're working underneath the canopy to pour the apron there by either Monday or Tuesday.
**Jdawson**: And this Mason, when is he out of here?
**Speaker 3**: He'll be ready to weld both beams in the lintel by Wednesday.
**Jdawson**: So how does this work out?
**Jdawson**: When are we giving notice to McRae that United's taken over?
**Jdawson**: When he's not done.
**Speaker 2**: We.
**Speaker 2**: We have to probably today.
**Speaker 2**: If.
**Speaker 2**: If United is doing asphalt next week.
**Jdawson**: If.
**Speaker 3**: If we give him that notice, it's probably going to look like United end up doing what's left underneath the canopy, too.
**Speaker 3**: Rick will just pull out of here.
**Jdawson**: And what's Rick say about the Pavement.
**Speaker 3**: As far as getting that done.
**Jdawson**: Well, have we discussed with him how he's wrapping up the paving or does he do that himself?
**Jdawson**: Is he hiring someone else to do it?
**Speaker 3**: He's hiring someone else to do it.
**Jdawson**: And they.
**Jdawson**: They're lined up to come in as soon as he pours the concrete and do it?
**Speaker 3**: No, he said that guy's two weeks out.
**Speaker 3**: He said that that guy's been backed up is what his excuse?
**Jdawson**: Well, Nick, if you want to drop off and see if you can get a hold of United, I mean.
**Speaker 1**: Because.
**Jdawson**: Then if we know we got them, then we just put McCray on notice and be done with it.
**Speaker 2**: You want me to add them to this call?
**Jdawson**: You can.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Not answering.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: If he.
**Speaker 2**: He confirms that he can do the asphalt right after McRae finishes the concrete under the canopy, then I'll send the notice to McRae.
**Speaker 3**: What.
**Jdawson**: What.
**Speaker 3**: What is, what is that you said, Nick, you'll send the notice after they finish the concrete underneath the apron.
**Speaker 3**: I meant the.
**Speaker 3**: Underneath the canopy.
**Speaker 2**: No, I would.
**Jdawson**: If.
**Speaker 2**: If he's able to come in right after they finish the concrete, then I'll send the notice to them.
**Speaker 2**: Because we have to give them a 48 hour notice, right?
**Speaker 3**: If.
**Speaker 3**: If so, that means, if so, if we give that notice today, 98, sure.
**Speaker 3**: Then Rick just won't pour that concrete underneath the canopy.
**Speaker 3**: So United has Florida.
**Speaker 3**: He said either Monday or Tuesday is what he said.
**Jdawson**: Are they.
**Jdawson**: They're not ready for it now?
**Speaker 3**: No.
**Speaker 3**: So if we give that notice today, then we have to be prepared for United to be able to also do.
**Speaker 1**: The work underneath canopy.
**Jdawson**: And your ethos guy is doing everything this weekend.
**Jdawson**: What is he doing?
**Jdawson**: The EEPhAs.
**Speaker 3**: He's doing the EFAs around the windows is what he can agree to me to do right now.
**Speaker 3**: They actually came a day early, so they're actually here right now to at least get started a little bit.
**Speaker 3**: And Glenmark's getting ready to wrap that corner with the EFAs glass, so they'll at least get patched around the windows and then in line can start painting most of the exterior as early as Monday.
**Jdawson**: What is he doing the canopy nefus?
**Speaker 3**: That's depending on when we get.
**Speaker 2**: Sack.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, I was just wondering what the status is for the concrete and the asphalt.
**Speaker 1**: Concrete in that storm.
**Speaker 1**: I know you still need to do the other side on the.
**Speaker 1**: On the dock side.
**Speaker 1**: And I'm trying to get a concrete guy from that because my original guy can't get there as quick.
**Speaker 1**: But I can get the asphalt by next Thursday.
**Speaker 2**: Well, what do you.
**Speaker 2**: I'm on the phone with a couple other people.
**Speaker 2**: Jesse, what do you think about that?
**Jdawson**: Hey, Zach, I guess the question is.
**Jdawson**: So you're not sure when you could get a concrete guy there to do any concrete work?
**Speaker 1**: I'm sorry.
**Speaker 1**: I have some background noise.
**Speaker 1**: Say it one more time, Jesse.
**Jdawson**: You're not sure when you could get a concrete sub in here to do it?
**Speaker 1**: I'm waiting on an answer back right now.
**Speaker 1**: I've got about seven guys that I've reached out to that do a lot of work for me, and I'm trying to get one of them to commit.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: And then I. I've got a commitment on the asphalt, the demo, and the prep work.
**Speaker 1**: I'm just waiting on that loadout on that dock side.
**Jdawson**: And if.
**Jdawson**: Is the curve done in that back alley to widen the alley?
**Speaker 1**: I don't believe the curb.
**Speaker 1**: I don't believe the curb is done right now.
**Speaker 1**: No, it's still got to be demoed out wide.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, but your guys would do that work when they're paving?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Does it get an asphalt patch in behind it, though?
**Jdawson**: Well, it just.
**Jdawson**: It just gets a curve.
**Jdawson**: Like, everything in the dock is concrete, but that part in the road, I guess we could pave it and just cut a curve in the back side of it.
**Speaker 1**: I guess.
**Speaker 1**: I.
**Speaker 3**: Okay, let me.
**Speaker 1**: I'm just trying to make sure I've got my head wrapped around exactly what's going on outside.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So right now you have a concrete guy under contract.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Obviously, he's not moving as quick as what you guys wanted to move.
**Speaker 1**: What is your.
**Speaker 1**: How far is he gonna get, let's say, by Tuesday of next week.
**Speaker 1**: Where do you foresee them being?
**Jdawson**: I perceive what I'm hearing.
**Jdawson**: Having poured the concrete under the new canopy, the donation vestibule.
**Jdawson**: Call it a donation canopy, and that's it.
**Jdawson**: And so.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so while they're pouring that.
**Speaker 1**: Do they have the ability to jump over and pour that curb while I've got concrete there?
**Jdawson**: I don't know their capabilities, but I would.
**Jdawson**: I would probably.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if they could or not, Jack.
**Jdawson**: Is that what they're.
**Jdawson**: Are they planning on doing, and have you been pushing them to get that curb in?
**Speaker 3**: I'm pushing them, but they're not guaranteeing me anything.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I would imagine their paving guy says he's weeks out, and they got this concrete work to do over there by the loading dock to pour that, so they're probably just thinking they'll wait till they get over there to do it, I'm sure.
**Speaker 3**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: The demo can.
**Speaker 1**: And I guess they start then whenever we.
**Speaker 1**: If we come in there and we start demoing asphalt, we can demo out that curve as well.
**Speaker 1**: And then whenever they come, put asphalt back.
**Jdawson**: As long as we can get our.
**Speaker 1**: Concrete guys scheduled, it's easy to pave up against something.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: As long as long as we get.
**Speaker 1**: The concrete guys scheduled.
**Speaker 1**: Scheduled to come in there and do something, form that up and pour it.
**Jdawson**: Say if we go in there Monday.
**Speaker 1**: And start doing demo work, Monday or Tuesday, start doing demo work, we can demo that curve, too, get to where.
**Jdawson**: It needs to be.
**Speaker 1**: And then if they would pour that, it'd be a lot easier if we did the demo and get everything ready for them.
**Speaker 1**: Be a lot easier for those guys on site.
**Speaker 1**: Just formally show up in court real quick.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Because that's a short enough run.
**Speaker 1**: You don't need a damn curve machine on that.
**Speaker 1**: Just hand for the same.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Like I said, Jesse, I'm.
**Speaker 1**: I'm doing all I can to try to get this thing resolved.
**Speaker 1**: Let me.
**Speaker 1**: I've got one or two more guys I have reached out to.
**Speaker 1**: Like I said, I know I'm waiting on.
**Speaker 1**: All I'm waiting on right now is a price for that demo and asphalt, and I'll have that covered.
**Speaker 1**: I will work on seeing if I can get somebody to jump over there, tie that curb in.
**Jdawson**: And then.
**Speaker 1**: So let me ask you this.
**Speaker 1**: Are your guys planning to stay on site and go to that back dock as soon as they're done with the canopy slab?
**Jdawson**: I think when we give them a notice that we're taking the paving away, he may say he's not doing anything more.
**Jdawson**: So I just got to be prepared for that, and that's okay.
**Speaker 1**: Here's your KCO walk.
**Speaker 1**: That's on Thursday or Friday, whenever that is.
**Speaker 1**: Hopefully, you got to push the Friday.
**Speaker 1**: It's not.
**Jdawson**: We'll see what we can do here.
**Speaker 1**: But does that bike loadout dock need to be completed before that walk?
**Jdawson**: The loading dock doesn't.
**Jdawson**: But, I mean, the owner really wanted it so they could start moving in through the loading dock.
**Jdawson**: But if we have all the other pavement done, they could, you know, use the new donation canopy to bring their stuff in.
**Speaker 1**: It's like me and Tristan were talking to me, and I haven't seen the side I'm going off, what Tristan has filled me in on.
**Speaker 1**: But obviously, we've got quite a bit of rock that's got to go in between that.
**Speaker 1**: The block.
**Speaker 1**: The block walls that are back on that.
**Speaker 1**: That loadout dock as well.
**Speaker 1**: So we'll have to get.
**Speaker 1**: Get that filled in, poured, and then bring a dingo or something in and dingo that rock around the back.
**Speaker 1**: And then does that get a concrete cap poured on top of it?
**Speaker 1**: 6 inches in, so it gets a slab poured back on that, too.
**Speaker 1**: This.
**Speaker 1**: Then I'll get poured monolithically with that dock.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Do you know that?
**Speaker 1**: Does that get poured monolithically?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: The interior side, the slab, the dock, the pit for the dock leveler.
**Jdawson**: All of that's one pour?
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Speaker 1**: Then we got to get rock in there before we.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, you'll probably get rock in there and then dig that rock back out.
**Speaker 1**: You can get rock on the inside because you have to get.
**Speaker 1**: You'll have to build you a tab to get your dingo in.
**Speaker 1**: Am I right?
**Jdawson**: What's the difference in just bringing in one of those small pumps to pump the concrete on the interior, or you're worried about getting stone?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I can line.
**Speaker 1**: We can line.
**Speaker 1**: Pump the inside.
**Speaker 1**: I'm more worried about rock.
**Speaker 1**: How deep is it?
**Speaker 1**: Five feet.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, yeah.
**Speaker 1**: You're not gonna wait that.
**Jdawson**: No.
**Speaker 2**: Five feet deep.
**Speaker 1**: Three, four foot wide.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, guys, I know you're in a 911 for this.
**Speaker 1**: Let me.
**Speaker 1**: Let me get off here.
**Speaker 1**: Try to make some more phone calls and said I. I've got the.
**Speaker 1**: The big part for the tco.
**Speaker 1**: I've got it worked on right now, and let me see if I can get somebody in there poor, and I know when I get.
**Speaker 1**: How quick I get.
**Speaker 1**: Let me make some phone calls.
**Speaker 1**: Fellas, give me.
**Speaker 1**: Give me a minute here.
**Jdawson**: I know.
**Speaker 1**: I know the severity of it.
**Speaker 1**: Let me.
**Speaker 1**: Let me keep going on it.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Appreciate it.
**Speaker 1**: Thanks, Jesse.
**Jdawson**: Thanks.
**Jdawson**: So, yeah, it sounds like they're going to be in their demo, and their paving crew will be in there Monday or Tuesday.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, the timing on the notice is delicate with trying to get the most we can out of that dude and putting it on him at the right time, because as soon as he sees that email, he's probably going to pull off.
**Jdawson**: Definitely.
**Jdawson**: Well, is he working this weekend to try to get it prepped for a Monday pour?
**Speaker 3**: He said he'll try.
**Speaker 3**: He's.
**Speaker 3**: He's bouncing between us and another contractor this weekend that's in the same situation as us as what he told me.
**Speaker 3**: And while we were in this meeting now and Zach was talking.
**Speaker 3**: Rick's not here, but his guys are, I talked to one of the guys in the field, and with the progress that they've Made today with the updated 315.
**Speaker 3**: They're even more confident now that they're going to pour on Monday.
**Speaker 3**: They finished up the curb at the.
**Speaker 3**: If you're walking into the parking lot at the far north side where it.
**Speaker 3**: Where it comes down and wraps around, They've finished that curb right there.
**Speaker 3**: They have now attached the sidewalk.
**Speaker 3**: They had one pad left.
**Speaker 3**: They've now fully attached that.
**Speaker 3**: They poured that, and they poured concrete.
**Speaker 3**: They got a.
**Speaker 3**: There's a truck right here, right now that's shooting concrete around the inlet.
**Speaker 3**: So then on Monday is what he told me is when.
**Speaker 3**: Is when they plan on pouring the base at the columns and the apron.
**Speaker 3**: And the apron.
**Jdawson**: But why don't they pour in the actual concrete slab under the canopy?
**Speaker 3**: So when I said apron, that's what I was referring to my bed.
**Speaker 3**: They're pouring the pad underneath the canopy on Monday with the base at the columns.
**Speaker 3**: I got the boards up for all the base.
**Jdawson**: But when we send him notice Monday, it's noticed that we're.
**Jdawson**: He's got 48 hours to complete the pavement, and if he doesn't, we're getting someone else in.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, then that would be.
**Speaker 3**: That would set right into.
**Speaker 3**: We at least accomplished what he was trying to get done, which was at least underneath the canopy.
**Speaker 3**: So Monday would be a better day to do.
**Speaker 3**: If we do it now, he won't pour nothing on Monday.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, Monday, end of the day, probably.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: And we'll just make Zach note he doesn't show up Monday to do any of this.
**Jdawson**: He's gonna have to show up Tuesday or possibly Wednesday, and then maybe we finish and pave it Friday.
**Speaker 2**: So if we send it end of day Monday, then he.
**Speaker 2**: You want to be able to start until Thursday?
**Jdawson**: Well, no, you could start Wednesday because end of day Tuesdays, that's 24 hours.
**Speaker 2**: It says 48 hours in the contract, which would be end of day Wednesday.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: And we can also.
**Jdawson**: We don't have to give notice for.
**Jdawson**: We can terminate anything we want for convenience.
**Jdawson**: So we just send him a notice Monday after he pours it and say due to your.
**Jdawson**: Your scheduled two weeks out on pavement, we're removing it from your contract.
**Jdawson**: We're having it done by someone else.
**Jdawson**: It's very clean.
**Jdawson**: Doesn't say he can't finish the concrete either.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: I don't know.
**Jdawson**: I'll have to look at that and see.
**Jdawson**: What if it's terminating the whole contract or terminate portions of it.
**Jdawson**: I haven't done that before, so I'll have to take a Look at that.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I'll check it, too, because usually you just can wipe your hands clean of the whole thing if you want to.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, well, based on the way he's moving, they'll pour the loading dock quicker.
**Speaker 3**: Do y' all want me to still keep us on schedule for the TCO walk on Thursday at noon or check availability for Friday to give Zach more time to finish the pavement out there?
**Jdawson**: Well, the tco.
**Jdawson**: I don't know that that relies on the pavement, since we're TC on the inside of the building.
**Speaker 3**: To get the.
**Speaker 3**: To get the tco.
**Speaker 3**: The building department told me that we'd have to get Goodwill Bloomington Planning department involved, and she said that they.
**Speaker 3**: One of their items to be able to approve for TCO is striping in the parking lot.
**Speaker 3**: I haven't rebuttal back to her yet.
**Speaker 3**: And just.
**Speaker 3**: And ask if, like, if there's flexibility with that, if, like, we can get IT approval.
**Speaker 3**: But like, a side note of, hey, we plan on striping on this day.
**Speaker 3**: We'll provide pictures, kind of.
**Speaker 3**: Kind of set up, if that makes sense.
**Jdawson**: Well, we're going to have to temp stripe it.
**Jdawson**: You can't permanent stripe the day after you pave anyways.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so, I mean, we could throw some paint down.
**Jdawson**: Looks like a line.
**Jdawson**: I mean, that's all they need.
**Jdawson**: Which we can have Zach do.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if you included that in his scope to have him do.
**Speaker 2**: I haven't talked to him.
**Speaker 2**: Talk to him about that.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Ms. Jesse.
**Jdawson**: Hey, Zach.
**Jdawson**: One second, Jack.
**Jdawson**: Is the rebar for the loading dock on site?
**Jdawson**: The concrete?
**Speaker 3**: Yes, but if we give him notice, Rick's going to take that with him.
**Jdawson**: Well, he can't.
**Speaker 3**: Can we keep that?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, if we've been billed for it, they can't just take it.
**Speaker 3**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So Nick, look into that and see what they build for.
**Jdawson**: Check on that.
**Jdawson**: Okay, that's fine.
**Jdawson**: Really.
**Speaker 1**: Supplies are in the kitchen app, so I figured.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, because.
**Jdawson**: Well, yeah, I mean, what we're gonna.
**Jdawson**: We're.
**Jdawson**: We're gonna do like I would want them to.
**Jdawson**: If they can pour that.
**Jdawson**: That canopy concrete and wrap that up Monday, then I'll send them the notice.
**Jdawson**: And regardless of what they.
**Jdawson**: They can tell me, they're gonna stay and finish the loading dock, but they're not doing the pavement no matter what.
**Jdawson**: So, you know, if we send him notice on Monday, technically I have to wait till Wednesday, but I. I wouldn't really care because if he says, forget you guys anyways, it doesn't matter because you were Talking about starting Tuesday, the demo for it.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Because then we'll just have to push the.
**Jdawson**: I think it's just stock blank stuff.
**Jdawson**: They'll lay in there because they usually.
**Jdawson**: I'd have to see.
**Jdawson**: Jack, is.
**Jdawson**: Is this detailed steel for the pit?
**Speaker 3**: Sorry, what was that?
**Jdawson**: Is there.
**Jdawson**: There's detailed bent bars for the elevator or for the dock leveler pit?
**Speaker 3**: Yes.
**Speaker 3**: Around.
**Speaker 3**: Around the.
**Speaker 3**: Around the edges there is.
**Jdawson**: There's a stack of rebar laying there for that.
**Speaker 3**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So it's all there.
**Jdawson**: All the stuff that's custom for it.
**Jdawson**: Okay, thanks.
**Jdawson**: Bye.
**Jdawson**: That was Zach.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: What's he.
**Speaker 3**: What's he thinking?
**Jdawson**: He's checking with the.
**Jdawson**: With it, but his best case on a concrete guy is getting here at the end of next week, Thursday at best or Friday.
**Speaker 3**: With that being said, well, we'll still.
**Speaker 1**: I will.
**Speaker 3**: Then of course, we'll have to figure out a new date.
**Speaker 3**: Maybe he can get it done by then.
**Speaker 3**: As of right now, we were telling.
**Jdawson**: Andrew Molder that they could back a truck in here after the first week in September.
**Jdawson**: Oh.
**Speaker 3**: September 2nd.
**Jdawson**: That's.
**Jdawson**: That's the following Monday.
**Speaker 3**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: And the scaffolding is not even going to be out of the way until Wednesday.
**Speaker 3**: Till Wednesday.
**Jdawson**: Are these masons working this weekend?
**Speaker 3**: As of right now, I don't have.
**Speaker 3**: I.
**Speaker 3**: As of right now, I don't think they are.
**Speaker 3**: They haven't given me any full confirmation that they are.
**Speaker 3**: What was.
**Speaker 3**: What was about to take place?
**Speaker 3**: What was about to take place was on Wednesday when McRae mobilized.
**Speaker 3**: Rick had offered a plan which he calls wishful thinking, that, hey, if we agree to have the mason break down on their scaffolding and demobilize for until Tuesday, that he could have worked.
**Speaker 3**: That he would have gotten the dock door area done by Monday evening or Tuesday morning.
**Speaker 3**: And then he called me back Friday morning and canceled and was a lot of frustration on the phone about old shit and was like, I'll work my best to get underneath the canopy, but it ain't gonna happen at the doctor.
**Speaker 3**: And because of blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
**Speaker 3**: So the masons did give a price to actually demobilize for Thursday and Friday and Monday.
**Speaker 3**: And then when Rick called me Thursday.
**Jdawson**: When we called demobilizing to now we want him to work the weekend.
**Speaker 1**: Like.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, I mean, I. I called the masons back Thursday before they broke down the scaffold early in the morning and ran over there and told them, dude, don't.
**Speaker 3**: Don't break it down.
**Speaker 3**: Continue working.
**Speaker 3**: And Wednesday is one of David Jones worst case Dates with.
**Speaker 3**: There's a potential chance that they finish up sooner.
**Jdawson**: Nick, can you call them and see if they'll work this weekend and get done and the out of here?
**Jdawson**: Because if we put this guy on notice and all he's got to do is take pictures of what we're putting them on notice for, which will be the asphalt work, it kind of won't matter.
**Jdawson**: But find out if they'll work this weekend and get this done.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: We have to get them done and out of there.
**Jdawson**: So you can hang up or call them, whatever, but.
**Speaker 1**: It.
**Speaker 3**: Oh.
**Jdawson**: I guess it's just Jesse's name.
**Jdawson**: Are they answering, Nick?
**Speaker 2**: No, he did not answer.
**Speaker 2**: I texted him.
**Speaker 3**: He text.
**Speaker 3**: Did you call David Jones?
**Speaker 2**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: Let me.
**Speaker 3**: Do you have Chris's number, the sister company with Rock Solid?
**Speaker 2**: No.
**Speaker 2**: Can you send it to me?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: David, just text back.
**Speaker 2**: He's calling Chris.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: That's.
**Speaker 3**: That's who's been running the crew out here.
**Jdawson**: So asking can we just knock this out tomorrow, be done, get the welder in there Monday, weld it and be done with it.
**Jdawson**: So getting the stone in here is the problem.
**Jdawson**: So they want to ramp up some stone inside of this loading dock area, drive a buggy into there so they can dump the stone into the backside of the wall.
**Jdawson**: Is there a local company there that has the stone thrower and would come in and place the stone completely for you?
**Speaker 3**: United actually has their own stone and he's let me know before he can get it quick.
**Jdawson**: I know the stone, but placing it, getting it behind that wall.
**Speaker 3**: And look into.
**Speaker 1**: Sounds great.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: And I think having him here, too, somehow.
**Speaker 1**: Wait, I wanted this or I want to take a in the kitchen or I don't like.
**Jdawson**: To hear back from Zach.
**Jdawson**: And get the mason.
**Jdawson**: Let us know what you get with that.
**Jdawson**: And then I'm going to call Andrew Mulder because, I mean, if he's under the assumption they're going to be using this thing on the second, that ain't going to happen.
**Speaker 1**: Did they give up on the bringing those racks in, Jack?
**Speaker 3**: No.
**Speaker 3**: So I told before I said yes or no to Andrew when the fire marshall came out to do kind of just a courtesy walk with us and just talk with us about a couple things.
**Speaker 3**: I saved his personal number on my personal phone, so he told me to actually give him a ring anytime if I got questions.
**Speaker 3**: I reached out to him and he said he's fine with the clothes racks coming in the building, but do not bring in any product.
**Speaker 3**: He doesn't care if it's even sitting to the side or anything.
**Speaker 3**: Only.
**Speaker 3**: Only the racks.
**Jdawson**: Wait a minute.
**Jdawson**: So they're bringing in racks?
**Jdawson**: That's their plan this weekend?
**Speaker 3**: No, on.
**Speaker 3**: Andrew texted me on Wednesday asking if I could clean the sales floor because he wanted to bring in racks on Monday.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so who's cleaning the sales floor?
**Speaker 3**: When I talked with Nick and Jesse, we were going through plan of everything.
**Speaker 3**: I then talked to Andrew a little bit about what my original plan was to do a final cleaning on this date.
**Speaker 3**: He was like, it's actually fine if you guys don't clean.
**Speaker 3**: You can just clean them around.
**Speaker 3**: And we're fine with that.
**Jdawson**: But they're bringing them in when?
**Speaker 1**: Month.
**Speaker 3**: This coming Monday.
**Jdawson**: I mean, you have a labor there that could at least sweep and mop the floors.
**Jdawson**: So they're.
**Speaker 3**: I. I did today.
**Speaker 3**: I had a labor out here that swept everywhere.
**Jdawson**: Okay, and were they bringing them through the front entry?
**Jdawson**: Through the front entry, yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right, Just go ahead, Jesse.
**Speaker 1**: One thing I just wanted to mention is, Nick, didn't you say to Andrew today that you'd have a schedule sent to him by the end of the day?
**Speaker 3**: We told Andrew we'd let him know a date by the end of today of when he can use that dock door, which.
**Speaker 3**: Jesse Dawson, did you mention that you.
**Speaker 3**: You wanted to call?
**Jdawson**: I'm going to.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Because I think he's under a false assumption.
**Speaker 3**: Right.
**Speaker 3**: I was just asking, like, if.
**Speaker 3**: If you were calling him over you like.
**Speaker 3**: Like for us to.
**Speaker 3**: To reach out to him.
**Jdawson**: No, I'll call.
**Jdawson**: All right, guys, I'll talk with you and just keep updated.
**Jdawson**: Just shoot emails or teams, message about as you find out information, and then we'll plan for Monday.
**Jdawson**: Doing a Godfather or concrete sub.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, can you.
**Speaker 1**: Jack and Nick, can you guys hang out for two seconds when we end the call?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, just hang on for a second.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, he left us.
**Speaker 1**: Did David say bye?
**Jdawson**: I didn't.
**Speaker 1**: So are you guys all Godfather exit on what we need to do with every moving part of this and how much we need to communicate?
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, step one.
**Speaker 3**: I mean, I'm gonna just.
**Speaker 3**: Would you like me to maybe just voice it all out loud of what.
**Speaker 3**: Where my mind's at with all of it.
**Speaker 3**: And then y' all kind of interrupt to say, wait, wait.
**Speaker 3**: If you have any questions or anything.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: And then does someone have the capacity to just summarize this for us and should shoot the three of us an email so we have a guide to know what we have to stay on and when we have to stay on it.
**Speaker 2**: Okay, I'll write something.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: And we got the note taker in here, too, so.
**Speaker 1**: Fire away, Jack.
**Speaker 3**: Okay, so starting at the dock door area, it's going to be really beneficial if the mason can work tomorrow and potentially then be ready as soon as Monday to have that welder come in and weld those beams so that they could break down their things and be out of there as early as Tuesday if Zach is able to start on it that, that soon.
**Speaker 1**: And that's one.
**Speaker 1**: Sorry, one question I have on that is, are we going to have to account for another change order for overtime for this mason if they say yes to working this weekend?
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: We just want to be mindful of that cost.
**Speaker 3**: Definitely.
**Speaker 3**: Definitely.
**Speaker 3**: So that, that's, that's a big kicker for back there to move over now to the canopy.
**Speaker 3**: Since we're not going to give the notice today to McRae and Sons.
**Speaker 3**: They're going to pour concrete underneath the canopy on Monday as long as.
**Speaker 3**: As well as the base underneath the columns.
**Speaker 3**: With the base being poured underneath the columns, I then can mobilize and continue on with framing around those columns and getting that on schedule and also getting EFAs on schedule.
**Speaker 3**: Of course, I don't.
**Speaker 1**: So one thing I just wanted to throw in there to help this out.
**Speaker 1**: When you're on the ground while all this is going on, get timelines out of this concrete foreman.
**Speaker 1**: You know, like, hey, when do you think you're going to be pouring this concrete today?
**Speaker 1**: What time are you going to be doing this?
**Speaker 1**: What time are you going to be doing that?
**Speaker 1**: And that way you're going to be able to know while it's all going on if something's slipping and we need to do something about it.
**Speaker 3**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: So, like, so basically come, come Monday, asking at what time the truck's coming.
**Speaker 1**: Ask them what time trucks are coming.
**Speaker 1**: What time do you think they're going to be done pouring all that stuff?
**Speaker 1**: Just get the whole.
**Speaker 1**: All the information you can out of them on what they're doing.
**Speaker 1**: So that way, as they're doing it during the day, you'll be able to know, this doesn't look right.
**Speaker 1**: This looks slow.
**Speaker 1**: And then you can talk to them and keep it going.
**Speaker 3**: Gotcha.
**Jdawson**: Will do.
**Speaker 1**: Thank you.
**Speaker 1**: And then just a ton of pictures, please.
**Speaker 3**: Totally.
**Speaker 1**: Like, totally.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Send us.
**Speaker 1**: Send pictures at the end of today of where they're at with forming and whatever they're prepping everywhere and all that stuff, please.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, will do.
**Speaker 1**: And then do we have.
**Speaker 1**: Sorry, one more thing.
**Speaker 1**: I don't want to forget to mention during this.
**Speaker 1**: We have it accounted for to.
**Speaker 1**: For your temporary enclosure for that loading dock door.
**Speaker 3**: What, the price?
**Speaker 1**: No, just when we need to get it.
**Speaker 1**: Get that done because we don't want to be having people over working over each other over there.
**Speaker 3**: Oh, it's.
**Speaker 1**: It's.
**Speaker 3**: It's done.
**Speaker 1**: It's done.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, they did it today.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, cool.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Speaker 1**: Did they give you a price?
**Speaker 3**: Griffin didn't.
**Speaker 3**: He said that knowing how his father gives prices, that it would be cheaper to do it on tnm.
**Speaker 3**: And last time he did it, did an enclosure for us on tnm, it was only a couple hundred bucks.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, their.
**Speaker 2**: Their costs have been working out to be cheaper on tnm.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, sometimes that's the way it works out.
**Speaker 1**: Just like you said, his dad's probably a stickler when he gives prices, especially on small stuff.
**Speaker 3**: Right.
**Speaker 3**: So H Vac is on schedule for Monday to come out and fire up the ac.
**Speaker 3**: And our framers are also the guys that drop tile, and they're have been informed to prepare to drop tile on Monday as well.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, good.
**Speaker 1**: And as far as overlap, you're keeping an eye on, you know, because it looks like there's pretty limited access points to these work areas.
**Speaker 1**: So just that coordination to be mindful of.
**Speaker 1**: Tempo.
**Speaker 2**: Always something that could really screw us is if he does take that rebar.
**Speaker 1**: Well, he's.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, but he's.
**Speaker 1**: That's one thing.
**Speaker 1**: Jack, you're going to have to watch because like Jesse said, if that's been built for we own that, that's no longer his.
**Speaker 1**: True.
**Speaker 1**: Because that would have probably been in his July pay app.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: Or June.
**Speaker 2**: So for re.
**Speaker 2**: For working on the doc leveler pan, the interior floor and apron, he's billed $2,000 out of 20,000 in that line item.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And he.
**Speaker 2**: He didn't do the saw cut.
**Speaker 2**: That was a different contractor.
**Speaker 2**: So I guess that has to be billing material, I would think.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: I'm gonna look real quick.
**Speaker 2**: Doesn't specifically say material versus, but yeah, they.
**Speaker 2**: They haven't done any of that work, so I guess that has to be material.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: I'm just asking Chat GPT for the cost of that rebar package.
**Speaker 1**: Holy shit.
**Speaker 1**: I stumped.
**Speaker 1**: Chat GPT.
**Speaker 1**: I couldn't find specifics for rebar packages.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, no, this is notion.
**Speaker 1**: Oops.
**Speaker 2**: But we haven't paid them for that billing yet.
**Speaker 1**: That's the July one, right?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Oh, yeah.
**Speaker 1**: That payment's probably going to go out this today, wouldn't it?
**Speaker 2**: Well, I Told them to hold the payment.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, okay.
**Speaker 1**: That's different.
**Speaker 1**: Is everything that's captured in that payment completed on site?
**Speaker 1**: Like you check the pay app?
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, I look over them before I approve them each month, I will get them a check.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, so is there.
**Speaker 1**: Are we just holding that guy's payment because of the way he's been acting, or is there something on it?
**Speaker 2**: I asked yesterday for accounting to hold it.
**Speaker 2**: They hadn't released it yet, but I told him just hold it for now until we figure out what we're doing in this situation.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: Because our payment terms are paid when paid, so it's not like we.
**Speaker 2**: We have a specific timeline.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: I'm gonna guess that that 2,000 bucks is rebar because it says it's about $2,250.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, they haven't done any work on it yet, so it has to be.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, that's definitely the materials.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, we just want to be mindful of that because he's submitted his pay app and we're not outside of our time frame to pay it like our net 30.
**Speaker 1**: So please keep that factor in mind because we're probably going to want to release that if we're going to put him on notice.
**Speaker 2**: The payment.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Because correct me if I'm wrong, but in theory, that squares us up with him for all the shit he completed up to August.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: Like, he's done more work than that check is associated with.
**Speaker 2**: Maybe he hasn't done too much in the last month.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, but that's not going to be on the pay app we're talking about.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: Because you're talking about the August pay app now with the last month.
**Speaker 1**: Because at the end of the month.
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, I'm sure they're billing a little more in August.
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Speaker 1**: Is this billing cycle the 25th for him to have his pay up due to you buy?
**Speaker 2**: Yeah, I think they already turned it in.
**Speaker 2**: They usually.
**Speaker 2**: They usually do.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: That finance is going to be important.
**Speaker 1**: So when we have a call on Monday afternoon to talk issuing this notice, let's just include that as part of the conversation.
**Speaker 1**: What else you got, Jack?
**Speaker 3**: Well, the block guy just called me and said that he can't work Saturday, but he can work Sunday.
**Speaker 3**: So.
**Speaker 3**: And that would.
**Speaker 3**: That would have him finish up, I guess.
**Speaker 3**: Chris has said his boss is going to reach out.
**Speaker 3**: I don't.
**Speaker 3**: He said.
**Speaker 3**: To our office.
**Speaker 3**: I don't know if he meant you, Nick, or Jesse, just to make sure that we're gonna cover the premium on the overtime.
**Speaker 2**: And then now I Think it makes sense at the stage we're at?
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, 100%.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: So I agree.
**Speaker 3**: So then Chris is now working on lining up his welder for Monday.
**Speaker 1**: And that's change order welding, right?
**Speaker 3**: Yes.
**Speaker 3**: And that's what what's been told to me is that they'll keep it under 500 bucks.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, we save some, some money there because SCFAB wanted to do it for a little over a thousand.
**Speaker 3**: So then.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, that's, that's everything I got for the canopy and the doctor area situations.
**Speaker 1**: Let's talk through the whole, the whole scope because I mean we're talking finishing a lot of stuff next week.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Do we need to talk of anything through on this loading dock, port back, the coordination, the tile, anything like that?
**Speaker 3**: I mean definitely once, once he forms the boards up and forms up the bottom and Rick was going to pour the, the pit of it first.
**Speaker 3**: I don't know how Zach is going to do it, but definitely before I pour it, I have an electrician on standby of exactly where he needs to rough in his electrical.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, run this conduit in it.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: So that was for, for power for the pit for the leveler.
**Speaker 3**: So he's got all the information he needs.
**Speaker 3**: He just needs me to give him exact day when to release him to rough all that in.
**Speaker 1**: So they're not there.
**Speaker 1**: They don't have anyone on site.
**Speaker 1**: We gotta assume this guy's gonna come to site as soon as you call him and tell him who the electrician?
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, no, he's still on site.
**Speaker 1**: He's been okay.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, he's been kind of.
**Speaker 3**: I mean he's definitely like, hey look, I'm getting low on work, I don't want to leave but so I'm like, you know, hey, you know, let's, let's device out, let's do this.
**Speaker 3**: I mean it bought us a little bit more time with the concrete guy hitting his, hitting his power line so that he worked on that and then he spent a lot of time today getting panel schedules together for close out documents.
**Speaker 3**: So we're still finding at least enough for him to get by on some like stretching out the eights kind of thing, if you know what I mean.
**Speaker 3**: So that.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 3**: So he's not like just sitting in the van waiting.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: I mean just obviously give him as much many updates and advance notice as you can.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Which I mean it's not going to be much because it's such a tight schedule.
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: I mean at this point I think that's what we can do.
**Speaker 1**: And then it's.
**Speaker 1**: It's just real important, Jack, to get a lot of pictures right before they pour that.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So we can see everything in the rebar structure and everything for that.
**Speaker 1**: And.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, just kind of keep it in your head that.
**Speaker 1**: To kind of punch out this stuff as it's getting completed.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: To make sure.
**Speaker 1**: Because we're also rushing, so we got to be mindful of skipping shit.
**Speaker 1**: You know what I mean?
**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
**Speaker 3**: And maintaining quality.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So we don't want that to slide while we're doing all this.
**Speaker 3**: I agree.
**Speaker 1**: And then another.
**Speaker 1**: Another big thing is to make sure these.
**Speaker 1**: That they're cleaning these areas up.
**Speaker 1**: They're done.
**Speaker 1**: Because that's the other part of rushing.
**Speaker 1**: They're going to just try to tear shit out and leave.
**Speaker 1**: True.
**Speaker 1**: All right, if you guys are good, let's just plan on catching up at our Monday call.
**Speaker 1**: And then if somebody hears from anyone, just utilize that group chat we have, please.
**Speaker 3**: Definitely.
**Speaker 1**: All right, guys.
**Speaker 1**: Thank you.
**Speaker 2**: Okay, thanks.
**Speaker 1**: Appreciate all the.
**Speaker 1**: On this.
**Speaker 3**: Appreciate yourself.
**Speaker 1**: Thank you.
**Speaker 1**: Thank you.
