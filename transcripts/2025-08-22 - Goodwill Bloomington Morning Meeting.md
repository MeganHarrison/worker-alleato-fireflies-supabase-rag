## Transcript
**Jcurtin**: Guys are back here continuing to work around the canopy.
**Jdawson**: So they came earlier than they normally do.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, today they did.
**Jcurtin**: So they already got the boards up around each one of the columns.
**Jcurtin**: They're still looking to pour either Monday or Tuesday.
**Jcurtin**: Painters are here tightening up things around the building, around the outside, around the inside of the building.
**Jcurtin**: In the back of house.
**Jdawson**: Here, this is a alleatogroup.
**Jdawson**: Hey, Zach, that's concrete.
**Jdawson**: And I guess the concrete guys are actually working on it right now.
**Bclymer**: How are they doing today?
**Jdawson**: Do you think they're gonna pour that.
**Jdawson**: That concrete, Jack?
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, I think they're gonna pour that by Monday or Tuesday.
**Jcurtin**: But if he could still.
**Jcurtin**: If Zach can still help us out about the situation at the doctor, that would be.
**Bclymer**: That would be helpful.
**Bclymer**: Concrete guys taking care of that back curve, too, Nick?
**Jdawson**: They.
**Jdawson**: They haven't started on that.
**Bclymer**: No, but we need to figure taking care of all the stuff in the dock.
**Bclymer**: The dock and the interior that got demoed out around the dock and then also that curb.
**Jdawson**: I would say so.
**Bclymer**: And the asphalt up front.
**Jdawson**: Yes, asphalt.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Okay, thanks.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: If.
**Jdawson**: Dara, you want to continue with your update?
**Jdawson**: Jack?
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, like I said, painters are tightening up things on the inside.
**Jcurtin**: They're expecting to be 100% done done by the end of this weekend with everything inside.
**Jcurtin**: And then they'll start on the exterior next week.
**Jcurtin**: I mean, as in next week, as in Monday.
**Jcurtin**: Electrician.
**Jcurtin**: He's got some things to do around the dock door area, and then he's got to remount some of the data drops and receipts over where we did the windows and everything.
**Jcurtin**: We're just waiting for them to tighten up.
**Jcurtin**: The windows are done.
**Jcurtin**: Done.
**Jcurtin**: The dense glass has already been wrapped on the outside around the exterior.
**Jcurtin**: We're now just waiting on.
**Jcurtin**: We're now just waiting on the EFIS guy to come this weekend to now patch the EFIs around the windows.
**Jcurtin**: Duru confirmed that he'll be here Saturday to start on that.
**Jcurtin**: What's that?
**Jdawson**: Were you saying that Andrew wanted something else or different on this?
**Bclymer**: So.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, so Andrew mentioned to me at that.
**Jcurtin**: At the front face of where the main Goodwill sign is above the front door right there.
**Jcurtin**: If you look at a picture that I that I sent when I pointed to it with, with my two fingers, those two EFIs bump out crown molding type of material right there is all white.
**Jcurtin**: Everywhere else is gray.
**Jcurtin**: So Andrew mentioned to just paint the gray there and have it match the existing everywhere else.
**Jcurtin**: So then I had inline cut a piece of EFIs farther east on the front of the building so that they can match that gray.
**Bclymer**: Hey Jack.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah?
**Bclymer**: Those are called bands.
**Jcurtin**: Oh, bands.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, those strips.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, right on, Becky.
**Bclymer**: Oh, of course.
**Bclymer**: How is the concrete guy?
**Bclymer**: Have you talked to Rick himself?
**Bclymer**: Has he got that excavator key back or anything?
**Jcurtin**: No.
**Jcurtin**: Well, they just pulled up like not even like 20 minutes ago.
**Jcurtin**: And I was walking things with the painter.
**Jcurtin**: So I haven't made.
**Jcurtin**: Made it to them yet to make, to track down.
**Jcurtin**: Hey, where's that key?
**Bclymer**: Is it a cat excavate?
**Bclymer**: Mini X?
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Caterpillar.
**Jcurtin**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: So any cat key will work to get that loaded.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jcurtin**: I mean as of right now, I couldn't get a hold of Rick to chase down that key.
**Jcurtin**: I told Kevin that, I mean with them taking the key that they're, you know.
**Bclymer**: Well, that's what I'm.
**Bclymer**: That's what I'm saying.
**Bclymer**: If there's a cat store right there, you can just send that concrete guy over there.
**Bclymer**: Tell him to buy a cat key.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, either that or hopefully one of his guys has the key right now that are on site.
**Bclymer**: Oh, cool.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jcurtin**: So I mean I'm hoping that they just.
**Jcurtin**: I don't know.
**Jcurtin**: One of the guys in the crew thought it was because we got two excavators out here.
**Jcurtin**: Maybe he got confused and thought was, were his.
**Jcurtin**: So.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, this is, this is exactly the kind of stuff.
**Bclymer**: Also, Dick, I was asking you about the equipment.
**Bclymer**: What we usually do with sharing.
**Bclymer**: How did that conduit issue does that resolve?
**Bclymer**: Jack?
**Bclymer**: It is.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: It got.
**Jcurtin**: It got a little ugly yesterday, but we got it.
**Jcurtin**: We got it resolved.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So it's fixed and we're all back.
**Bclymer**: Okay, cool.
**Jcurtin**: Fixed in backfill.
**Bclymer**: Do we have the cost?
**Jcurtin**: No, not yet.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: Can somebody get an email chain one for that?
**Jcurtin**: Definitely.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, there is one.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I saw the one.
**Bclymer**: I just didn't know if we had reached out after we knew it was complete and then trying to find it.
**Bclymer**: Jack, you had mentioned some other small task that needed to be done and you asked on tmm, which one is that?
**Jcurtin**: How about the welding?
**Bclymer**: I don't know.
**Bclymer**: There was something you asked to do on tnm.
**Bclymer**: I'm trying to find the email.
**Bclymer**: Well, if it comes up, the only reason I ask is anything we can avoid putting on TNM and get a higher dollar number for it.
**Bclymer**: That's definitely the route we want to go.
**Bclymer**: But I get it that there's some instances where you just can't do it.
**Bclymer**: Like that conduit.
**Jcurtin**: Gotcha.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: TNM is dangerous, man.
**Jcurtin**: Amen.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I did the $800 million TNM project once.
**Jdawson**: What do you do?
**Bclymer**: An $800 million TNM project?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it's a big project.
**Bclymer**: They only shut it down once to audit the finances from the owner.
**Bclymer**: This change order for the vault to the owner?
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Does this.
**Bclymer**: Does this description reflect whatever changes you made from the email I sent you on the subcontract?
**Bclymer**: Because after I sent that to you, I remembered that you said the landscape was taking care of the seating.
**Bclymer**: And then.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we had 1,000 in the estimate for like, resoding.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: But I don't think.
**Jdawson**: I haven't talked to United to see if they would be able to reside it, but yeah, I'll talk to them about that.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And then I saw you put.
**Bclymer**: Includes cleanup and disposal and landfill.
**Bclymer**: I don't know if I missed that when I reviewed it or you added it, but does that capture the concrete waste, too?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we just get the.
**Jdawson**: We pay for the dumpsters on site.
**Bclymer**: Oh, okay, so you got a concrete dumpster there still?
**Jdawson**: Well, we.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we.
**Jdawson**: We can get one.
**Bclymer**: We.
**Jdawson**: We have some extra money in there to.
**Jdawson**: In our.
**Jdawson**: In our estimate.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I'm guessing this piece that's coming out of there is going to be a little big to trickle in the regular dumpsters.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's.
**Bclymer**: That's fine.
**Bclymer**: And then do we.
**Bclymer**: Are we.
**Bclymer**: Is this overhead, the overtime work, Is this known like Jesse and Brandon know this is happening.
**Jcurtin**: For the block guys?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: It was Jesse that had told me to tell them to get on to overtime.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I would.
**Bclymer**: I would just change that one and say overtime hours at loading dock.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: If it's just labor.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And that one's good.
**Bclymer**: And then I saw that scaffold one.
**Bclymer**: I wanted to ask you guys about that.
**Bclymer**: So does that.
**Bclymer**: Is that with everything that's going on with Rick, is that quote, we're going to get it moved and it's going to stay out of the way till he's done and then put it back when we're ready.
**Bclymer**: Or do we.
**Bclymer**: We have a deadline with them?
**Bclymer**: We have to get that up by the end of the week.
**Bclymer**: Right.
**Jcurtin**: So about the one that David Jones of, like, how much it would cost to take the scaffolding?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, like 2700 or something like that.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, that one's been canceled.
**Jcurtin**: Because once Rick.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, once Rick canceled on us yesterday, then I immediately called the block guys and just said, working, don't take anything down.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And then I remembered the TNM Thing you asked about, it was closing in that opening so you could turn the AC on.
**Jcurtin**: Oh, yes.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so what.
**Bclymer**: What's going on with that?
**Jcurtin**: So that I can drop tile.
**Jcurtin**: I don't.
**Jcurtin**: I don't know when.
**Jcurtin**: So as far as completing that work over there, McRae and Sons won't guarantee anything, and United hasn't guaranteed a date of when it could be done, and I'm worried.
**Bclymer**: Are we talking about that area by that door with the sides of the slab cut out next to it?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jcurtin**: The doctor.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Thank you.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, yeah.
**Bclymer**: So that's the doctor.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, that's the dock door.
**Bclymer**: Oh, I thought it was aluminum storefront in the picture.
**Bclymer**: I just want to find it so I can see what you're talking about.
**Bclymer**: Mm.
**Bclymer**: I'm sorry.
**Jcurtin**: Oh, yeah.
**Jcurtin**: So for me to be able to get AC on in the back of house so that I can drop tile in the rooms, I just need that closed up.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Jcurtin**: Right now?
**Jcurtin**: Now.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's the one.
**Bclymer**: Did I lose everybody?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I think Jack was.
**Jdawson**: Was cutting out.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I think he's gonna probably drop out in a second here.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I wanted to just go through this and then go through that steel so we can make sure we're all on the same page.
**Bclymer**: And if we need to get that contract out, then let's get it.
**Bclymer**: Get it going.
**Bclymer**: Jack, can you hear us?
**Bclymer**: Hello?
**Jcurtin**: I'm sorry.
**Jcurtin**: Connection dropped back here.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, you kind of faded away.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, it's.
**Jcurtin**: It's like hit or miss out here for some reason.
**Jcurtin**: I have no idea.
**Jcurtin**: But, yeah, that's the.
**Jcurtin**: That's the doctor opening right there.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, so Glenmark has closed that up for us before, like when it was just existing and we had to close it up for security reasons, and it was a couple hundred bucks for them to slap.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, just.
**Bclymer**: I mean, it should be the same price if the framing is not different.
**Bclymer**: So, yeah, just go ahead and if that's what you need to do to get that done.
**Bclymer**: Are we absolutely certain it has to happen?
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, the H Vac guy did tell me that if that's not closed in, then it's going to cause the rooms to sweat and then the frame.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, and then the framer said if it's too humid back there, the tile will be.
**Jcurtin**: Will start to sag.
**Jcurtin**: So he didn't want to drop tile until the humidity was down in.
**Jcurtin**: The AC was on.
**Bclymer**: Nick, do you have any objections?
**Bclymer**: Couple hundred bucks.
**Bclymer**: Just get it done.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I don't.
**Jdawson**: I don't think that matters.
**Jdawson**: You know, you can do that.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, Sweet.
**Jcurtin**: So I'm gonna.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I'm sorry.
**Bclymer**: Just get the price out of them so we're not doing TNM on it.
**Bclymer**: That's all.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Awesome.
**Bclymer**: Awesome.
**Jdawson**: Oh, what's here?
**Jdawson**: You've got a different welder that you found, Jack?
**Jcurtin**: Yes.
**Jcurtin**: So the foreman for Rock Solid said that he has a third party welder that they'll weld it.
**Jcurtin**: And they said for sure It'll be under 500 bucks.
**Jcurtin**: Instead of that third party welder sending us the ticket and us paying him directly, Rocksaw is going to be the middleman, and they're just going to write the ticket and we pay Rock Solid and they figure out how to pay him so we don't get in any kind of liability or have to get him on insurance or.
**Jdawson**: Is he.
**Jdawson**: He's certified, Jack.
**Jcurtin**: He is certified.
**Jcurtin**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: He is.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I don't have a problem.
**Jdawson**: Problem with that.
**Bclymer**: He's insured and everything.
**Bclymer**: We don't want to have an issue with any of that.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I guess he's working under Rock Solid, so.
**Bclymer**: Oh, then if you guys already have them contracted, Cool.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: So it's just gonna be a change order.
**Bclymer**: Rock Solid.
**Jcurtin**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: Awesome.
**Jcurtin**: Awesome.
**Jcurtin**: And then.
**Jcurtin**: So that will release us from SC FAB coming out here to do and complete their change order of welding.
**Jcurtin**: So then that leaves us with.
**Jcurtin**: The only thing outstanding with SC FAB is their contracted work left, which is the angle tying in the joist and the wall.
**Jcurtin**: That they need the floor to be done to complete that in the inside so that they can run their scissor lift over it.
**Jcurtin**: And shooting the rest of the floor angle now to.
**Jcurtin**: To complete the rest of that.
**Jcurtin**: Nick, that's where my question with you is.
**Jcurtin**: We don't have.
**Jcurtin**: We don't have to pay a second mobilization charge, right.
**Jcurtin**: To complete that stuff.
**Jcurtin**: Because we.
**Jcurtin**: Everybody agreed that the schedule that they got in their contract showed a difference in time.
**Jcurtin**: So we weren't going to approve any more mobilization.
**Jcurtin**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I told them that because of the schedule shows that.
**Jdawson**: That we wouldn't improve that.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, awesome.
**Jcurtin**: So where they tried to kind of like, they're.
**Jcurtin**: They've.
**Jcurtin**: Everyone's agreed to that.
**Jcurtin**: But when we started trying to talk to them about welding those two beams, that's when they were like, okay, well, then that would be.
**Jcurtin**: That would be two more trips.
**Jcurtin**: So if we just have Rock Solid take care of the welding, then we can avoid another $2,000 plus mobilization from.
**Jcurtin**: From SCFAB.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: That's good then.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, awesome.
**Jcurtin**: So that's if that's cool.
**Jcurtin**: I'm gonna let Thomas know this morning after this meeting that we no longer need them to do the welding at the doctor and that I will be in touch with him regarding when the floor is going to be finished so that he can finish his contracted work Left.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: I see that you sent.
**Jcurtin**: I didn't look fully into the email yet but I got the alert that you sent something back to Rob regarding the water bottle filling station.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jdawson**: And he said it's a one to two day lead time on that.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: I'm in piping.
**Jcurtin**: Oh.
**Jcurtin**: So it looks like we.
**Jcurtin**: It's.
**Jcurtin**: We got it cheaper than that 4,000 he originally brought up.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay, good, good.
**Bclymer**: What.
**Jcurtin**: What did he end up changing and that that brought down the price.
**Jcurtin**: Do you know?
**Jdawson**: Or I guess it was a model.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: So we just got a different model but still accomplishing having a water bottle filler on it.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, cool.
**Jcurtin**: Hell yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Awesome.
**Jcurtin**: Are y' all okay with the painter?
**Jcurtin**: Just do we need to clarify that with.
**Jcurtin**: With Andrew again about the whole.
**Jcurtin**: Not.
**Jcurtin**: Sorry to jump around but the.
**Jcurtin**: Instead of painting all of the EFIs, what did you call it Jesse?
**Jcurtin**: The pads?
**Jdawson**: The.
**Jdawson**: The bands.
**Jcurtin**: The bands to paint all the existing bands gray or just the two that are up front that are white right now.
**Jdawson**: Does it look like the other ones need to be painted?
**Jdawson**: I think where we paid in line to paint the whole thing but whatever looks good.
**Jdawson**: And I think.
**Bclymer**: Do we need to make a markup and identify where the colors are going to make?
**Bclymer**: So.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, I mean of course it always runs into like yes, you could.
**Jcurtin**: You could get a sample and get a match but it may not be a hundred percent like of a match.
**Jcurtin**: You may still be able to say a difference in the grays because of the existing gray's been there for.
**Bclymer**: Oh dude, that does not matter.
**Bclymer**: With EFIs you can tint to age.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, sweet.
**Bclymer**: But did they cut it?
**Bclymer**: Did they have an existing piece to reference?
**Jcurtin**: Yes.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, I had them cut existing piece off.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Then they probably brought that and color matched it exact.
**Bclymer**: So it'll probably be very little notice in the difference.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, awesome.
**Bclymer**: I've done it with 5 year old red on the exterior of the building.
**Bclymer**: Man.
**Jcurtin**: Oh yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I couldn't.
**Bclymer**: That was when I first learned how to accurate.
**Bclymer**: That is it's very accurate to match those colors.
**Bclymer**: Oh sweet.
**Jcurtin**: Sweet.
**Jcurtin**: Amen.
**Bclymer**: Quote me on how they do it down there.
**Bclymer**: But that's what I've seen everywhere.
**Jcurtin**: Amen.
**Jcurtin**: Right on.
**Jcurtin**: And I guess that's a question back for you, Nick, but if.
**Jcurtin**: If we actually did pay them to paint all of it, and then I.
**Jdawson**: Think it's just whatever makes Goodwill happy and whatever looks good.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: If he wanted to leave that and he just wants to match.
**Jdawson**: Match this, I don't see a problem.
**Jdawson**: Problem with that.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: And then so do we.
**Jcurtin**: Do we just.
**Jcurtin**: Do we not, like, track down if we.
**Jcurtin**: If we're paying in line to actually paying all of it or if we're actually paying them to just paint, you know, two.
**Jdawson**: What I did was I. I sent them the elevations, and then they quoted painting the elevations.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, Gotcha.
**Jdawson**: Gotcha.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: I mean, it would definitely save us on some.
**Jcurtin**: Some time not painting all of the.
**Jcurtin**: All the bands, which is definitely helpful for our case right now.
**Bclymer**: We definitely want to make sure we know what we're doing before we buy colors.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, like before the contractor orders his colors.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we definitely want to put blocked in.
**Jcurtin**: Definitely as of right now that they're under the impression that they're just painting those two bands at the front and that's it.
**Jcurtin**: But nothing's.
**Jcurtin**: Nothing's been ordered yet until I.
**Jcurtin**: Until I get in touch with them, But I told them I would.
**Jcurtin**: I would talk with y' all today.
**Bclymer**: What's their contract say.
**Jdawson**: There?
**Jcurtin**: Go ahead.
**Jdawson**: They were supposed to paint these elevations.
**Jdawson**: It.
**Jdawson**: It didn't say to exclude these bands.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: What's this company called?
**Jdawson**: Inline painting.
**Jdawson**: There they are.
**Jdawson**: So, I mean, maybe we could ask them for credit for those bands if.
**Jdawson**: If Andrew was wanting to leave them as is.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it's.
**Bclymer**: Well, their inclusions are crystal clear.
**Bclymer**: So how much is there?
**Bclymer**: What's the value on this?
**Jdawson**: It was, I think, $7,000 to do the exterior change order to.
**Jdawson**: We did a change order for it.
**Bclymer**: Okay, let me look.
**Bclymer**: Is it in the change request?
**Jdawson**: It might be.
**Bclymer**: Just let me know what number when you find it.
**Jdawson**: So includes prepping and painting Goodwill design on exterior building per RFI 17.
**Jdawson**: Which RFI 17 is.
**Jdawson**: Is these elevations.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And they specifically said $7,000.
**Jcurtin**: It is.
**Jdawson**: 6,900.
**Bclymer**: Oh, thank you.
**Bclymer**: I'm still learning the tabs on job planner.
**Bclymer**: I could.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: I mean, that's.
**Bclymer**: There's no argument there.
**Bclymer**: I mean, is that all new EFIs or is there existing stuff there?
**Jdawson**: We.
**Jdawson**: We kind of repaired the existing.
**Jdawson**: Some of it, like behind the sign is all new.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: So the other is.
**Jdawson**: Is kind of repairs.
**Bclymer**: So is this, do you think, just a disconnect between the painters field guy in their office about the contract and the change order?
**Jdawson**: No, I guess when.
**Jdawson**: When Jack walked through with.
**Jdawson**: With Andrew, Andrew was wanting to keep.
**Jdawson**: This came about after we had the change order.
**Jdawson**: Jack walked with Andrew and Andrew.
**Jdawson**: And Andrew liked the color of the bands, so he was asking to keep these bands as is.
**Jdawson**: And then he wanted to match the.
**Jdawson**: These are white right now.
**Jdawson**: And he was wanting to match these to the existing color.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so the owner changed it.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Bclymer**: So is this the kind of owner that you do a change order for that for, or do you just find out?
**Jdawson**: No, because we.
**Jdawson**: We kind of.
**Jdawson**: We.
**Jdawson**: We contracted to do the whole building for him.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so.
**Bclymer**: So I. Yeah, that.
**Bclymer**: Can you see where I'm confused there?
**Bclymer**: Because we contracted.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, he added something.
**Jdawson**: Well, it's.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it's design build, I guess so.
**Bclymer**: So how much.
**Bclymer**: Do you have a rough square footage or do you know how much they want for to paint all the extra.
**Jdawson**: Well did this.
**Jdawson**: This is included in.
**Jdawson**: In our original contract with the owner.
**Bclymer**: All of the painting.
**Jdawson**: The.
**Jdawson**: The exterior.
**Bclymer**: Oh, okay.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, because it.
**Jcurtin**: It.
**Jcurtin**: How.
**Jcurtin**: How the situation kind of recently got brought up is when we were talking.
**Jcurtin**: I was talking about it with the planners and planning it and coordinating it, and then they were like, hey, you guys didn't give us an exact white at what you wanted at the top and bottom of these.
**Jcurtin**: Of these bands.
**Jcurtin**: And then that's when Angela was like, no, actually, we were expecting to stay with the gray and juice.
**Bclymer**: The.
**Jcurtin**: The area at the.
**Jcurtin**: On the front face where it's white right now, just paint it gray to match the rest.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so that.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, how do you want to handle it, Nick?
**Jdawson**: I think like we're expected to.
**Jdawson**: I mean, we.
**Jdawson**: When we did the contract with the owner, it was to give him like a complete, complete building, like ready to move in.
**Jdawson**: So.
**Bclymer**: But he excluded this.
**Bclymer**: But the way that I understood it, he excluded that existing paint specifically when we contracted, and then he added it.
**Bclymer**: Is that correct?
**Jdawson**: No, I don't.
**Jdawson**: I don't think it was excluded.
**Jdawson**: We really didn't.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so it's just more of a go ahead.
**Jdawson**: We should have had a better design from the beginning for the exterior.
**Jdawson**: So it was really kind of.
**Jdawson**: We should have done better on that.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that makes sense.
**Bclymer**: So it's on us.
**Bclymer**: So we just need to find out how much money they want.
**Bclymer**: Is that correct?
**Jdawson**: Oh, they want.
**Jdawson**: They wanted the $6,900, which I think we already approved that.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so if it's already approved, is there.
**Bclymer**: What's the.
**Jdawson**: It was just.
**Jdawson**: I don't think there's a question anymore.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: You're good, right, Jack?
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, I'm.
**Jcurtin**: I'm good.
**Jcurtin**: As far as we're.
**Jcurtin**: We're gonna match an existing gray.
**Jcurtin**: I'm gonna tell them after this meeting, go ahead and tee up the getting that gray.
**Jcurtin**: I guess the only one was for y' all if you, if you wanted to take a route where you contact the inline and was like, hey, that price you gave us was actually to paint all of the.
**Jcurtin**: Of the bands white.
**Jcurtin**: But since we only.
**Jcurtin**: We're only going to have you paint the gray and then ask about getting some, some credit.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I can ask him.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Alrighty.
**Bclymer**: Just so you guys know, I gotta jump.
**Bclymer**: I got another call.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Now, I sent a meeting invite out for 3:30 your time.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: If we hear from United before then, just let everybody know so we can get on a call.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Otherwise we'll just catch up and check on progress at the end of the day.
**Bclymer**: It'll just be a real quick call.
**Bclymer**: Okay?
**Jcurtin**: Sound good?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Cool.
**Bclymer**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Thank you guys.
**Bclymer**: Thanks.
**Bclymer**: See you.
