## Transcript
**Ataylor**: Okay, this should be better.
**Ataylor**: Okay, great.
**Bclymer**: Awesome.
**Bclymer**: How are you all?
**Ataylor**: Good.
**Ataylor**: I'm good.
**Ataylor**: Good.
**Ataylor**: How are you?
**Bclymer**: Awesome.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Oh good.
**Bclymer**: You know, we have a new person, her name is Ashley, as you know.
**Bclymer**: So she's going to start joining our meetings too.
**Ataylor**: She wants to be a little bit.
**Bclymer**: Part of, you know, a little bit of marketing.
**Bclymer**: She kind of helps a little bit of, you want to kind of learn about it.
**Bclymer**: So we just want to invite her in just to see, you know, how the marketing team works and you know, all the things that you guys do.
**Bclymer**: So just she can have a feel of that.
**Bclymer**: So yeah, so that's what I've been, I've been sending her your emails and also forwarding the invitation to her.
**Bclymer**: You're going to get to meet her soon.
**Ataylor**: Absolutely.
**Ataylor**: I saw her on there and she's on the September.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I saw that.
**Bclymer**: That, I love that caption.
**Bclymer**: That, that looks really good.
**Ataylor**: Okay, great.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, yeah.
**Ataylor**: I want to know like one or two things about her for the posts, like how many years experience she has.
**Ataylor**: Something to just flesh it out and make it a little bit more personal.
**Ataylor**: But yeah, I think that'll be good.
**Ataylor**: Looks like Brinkley is here.
**Bclymer**: Awesome.
**Bclymer**: That's good.
**Ataylor**: Hi, Brandon.
**Ataylor**: Hey, how you doing?
**Jdawson**: Hello.
**Mcalcetero**: How are you?
**Ataylor**: Good.
**Ataylor**: And we're going to look at the September calendar today and then go over the last posts we have for August which are going to be this week.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Do you want to wait for Ashley or do you want to jump right into it?
**Mcalcetero**: We can jump in.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: So first we're going to jump into the August approvals.
**Ataylor**: Right down to the bottom.
**Ataylor**: These are the September posts.
**Ataylor**: So the first video, there are six ready for you to approve from next month and then the one for this week and then these two other posts that we've looked at before but still need final approval.
**Ataylor**: I don't know if Jesse was able to look at the, the health care bills.
**Ataylor**: Do you know?
**Mcalcetero**: No.
**Mcalcetero**: Why don't you send a follow up note to him?
**Bclymer**: I don't think, I don't think he did.
**Bclymer**: Anika.
**Bclymer**: Let me just send that to him right now just to make sure.
**Bclymer**: He will approve it now.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Thank you.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Or else we can.
**Bclymer**: What did you say?
**Mcalcetero**: He has not gone through it yet.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: And then this post, we had edits done to it, so we just need your final confirmation.
**Bclymer**: Jesse, we need you now that you're here.
**Mcalcetero**: It's not that deep.
**Speaker 4**: Sorry.
**Bclymer**: We need you.
**Bclymer**: I do need you.
**Bclymer**: We need you to approve this right now.
**Bclymer**: As of before end of day.
**Ataylor**: You may, you may recognize this from a couple weeks ago.
**Mcalcetero**: Need is such a strong word.
**Speaker 4**: Yes.
**Mcalcetero**: Lack of options, maybe.
**Speaker 4**: It's probably fine.
**Ataylor**: I can go through each individually if you'd like.
**Ataylor**: Or we can just have you look at it on your own.
**Mcalcetero**: But just send that to him.
**Mcalcetero**: He.
**Mcalcetero**: It takes a while to get the motor revved up and, you know, process.
**Ataylor**: Okay, I'll resend it.
**Ataylor**: No problem.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, the, the.
**Speaker 4**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: And back to this.
**Ataylor**: That.
**Mcalcetero**: I don't know.
**Mcalcetero**: I mean, number five, I almost want to say, instead of establish comms, get shit done.
**Ataylor**: Okay, what about get things done?
**Ataylor**: That's not as impactful.
**Mcalcetero**: You can say get moving, maybe.
**Mcalcetero**: I guess.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, that works.
**Mcalcetero**: Because established comms is like, what's that mean?
**Mcalcetero**: Right?
**Mcalcetero**: It's.
**Mcalcetero**: We're not, this is not, you know, World War I, right?
**Ataylor**: You'd say hit the ground running or something similar to that.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, I would say, you know, like I said, get moving.
**Mcalcetero**: You know, like, you know, like, you know, something along those lines.
**Mcalcetero**: Like.
**Ataylor**: Okay, I'll make that final change and then this can go out today as long as you're happy at the bottom.
**Ataylor**: And then we're going to look at this video.
**Ataylor**: So the best way for me to do that is to show you this tab.
**Ataylor**: And yeah, I have eight videos from this, so.
**Bclymer**: You look good, Brandon.
**Ataylor**: You look good.
**Bclymer**: It's okay.
**Ataylor**: You look good.
**Speaker 4**: So the guy in the background looks pissed and he's staring right at you.
**Ataylor**: Let me know if you can hear the sound or if you can't hear the sound.
**Mcalcetero**: Biggest thing with traditional construction, delivery method, design, bid, build, is that the client goes in and says, I want xyz and the designer puts it on paper.
**Mcalcetero**: However, that design is more than that client's $10 million budget.
**Mcalcetero**: They go through the four to six month design period, they get done and then they take it out to get pricing and it's all of a sudden it's $12 million.
**Mcalcetero**: And you have to spend time going in value engineering, getting the builder's input on what's going to bring this in line to get you the building you need inside your budget.
**Mcalcetero**: Because at the end of the day, I mean, commercial construction, where, you know, it's all based off performer, it's based off numbers and the numbers have to pencil.
**Mcalcetero**: You know, business has to operate.
**Ataylor**: Okay, you can hear that.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yes, I think we sent you some comments about it.
**Bclymer**: We just said that I think Brandon needs.
**Bclymer**: He wants the letters, sorry, the words to go a little bit lower to his chest because I Think he's cover him?
**Mcalcetero**: I mean, I was just.
**Mcalcetero**: First of all, that guy's a tool.
**Mcalcetero**: Second of all, I just.
**Mcalcetero**: It was just a question.
**Mcalcetero**: I didn't know if there was, like, a standard or, like, what it should be like.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, it is.
**Mcalcetero**: I'm not gonna watch it.
**Mcalcetero**: I can barely stand watching it.
**Bclymer**: Oh, good.
**Mcalcetero**: But I just don't know what it should be.
**Bclymer**: So.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, Annika, you know, if you remember the dimensions, you know, for.
**Bclymer**: To maybe put it a little bit.
**Bclymer**: Is that the only one that we can have for.
**Bclymer**: For the dimensions?
**Bclymer**: I mean, the allow.
**Bclymer**: Dimensions were the worst to be seen on all platforms.
**Ataylor**: No, I mean, we can.
**Ataylor**: I put them in a space that for all platforms, allows for the copy at the bottom, like an Instagram and then the things on the left side.
**Ataylor**: And then for Facebook and LinkedIn, they have less constriction than on Instagram, so they're in an appropriate space.
**Ataylor**: But there's room to move them if you'd like to move them up or down a little bit.
**Mcalcetero**: I mean, I just.
**Mcalcetero**: It was just a.
**Mcalcetero**: Again, a comment.
**Mcalcetero**: So if you guys tell me it looks good and that's where it should be, then that's fine.
**Mcalcetero**: Me, if not, like, I'm sitting here like, oh, my God, the words.
**Ataylor**: I think it's concerned with the words I'm saying, because I'm like, I think it's good.
**Bclymer**: And the only thing that I said is just the caption.
**Bclymer**: Don't forget to add a CTI.
**Bclymer**: A CTA.
**Bclymer**: Sorry.
**Bclymer**: So, for example, like a LinkedIn, a link to our website, or a link to a project or a phone number or something, because right now the caption is just empty.
**Bclymer**: So there's no CTI to.
**Bclymer**: To go to cta.
**Ataylor**: Sorry.
**Mcalcetero**: You could add a little button that says, donate now.
**Jdawson**: Hey, guys.
**Ataylor**: Sorry I'm late.
**Jdawson**: I got hung up on a call.
**Bclymer**: You should have something that says, if you want to help this guy, click here.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Oh, help.
**Mcalcetero**: Help cure speech impediments.
**Mcalcetero**: Donate now.
**Ataylor**: I have this one going directly to the website, but I can put it somewhere else if you prefer.
**Bclymer**: Nothing that's good.
**Bclymer**: I think that's okay.
**Bclymer**: So we can have.
**Bclymer**: The idea is to send more people to our website projects because we're constantly adding more blog posts and all that stuff to the website.
**Bclymer**: So that'll be good.
**Bclymer**: I think that one is good to post today, actually, instead of the one you said previously.
**Bclymer**: So I think we can post it.
**Bclymer**: If you post it right now on LinkedIn, I can go ahead and post it on Instagram and Facebook.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Yep, yep.
**Ataylor**: This one is the one that we were planning on posting today.
**Ataylor**: Perfect.
**Bclymer**: Sounds good.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: So, yeah, we can go ahead and post this.
**Ataylor**: The edit or the download links are there for you in each of these just to make sure that you have those.
**Bclymer**: Thank you.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so that's the last for August, and then we can go up to September.
**Ataylor**: So I'm going to show you the month view first before we get into it.
**Ataylor**: So we've got Labor Day 5 Brandon videos.
**Ataylor**: Assuming that they all pass, you know, pass our judgment.
**Bclymer**: Maria's quality control.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
**Ataylor**: Then, Maria, you shared the Goodwill Foundation's pictures and information earlier.
**Ataylor**: So that's.
**Ataylor**: For the first week of September.
**Ataylor**: We're welcoming Ashley to the team.
**Ataylor**: We've got only two graphics because we want.
**Ataylor**: I know that we had some hesitation about why we really wanted to put too many graphics out there.
**Ataylor**: So there's only two, which is great because they're very specific.
**Ataylor**: And then we've got two more projects, TBDs, that I would like to highlight some more either images or updates or anything, but we need to solidify what those are.
**Ataylor**: So that's the grand overview.
**Ataylor**: So for Labor Day, it's just a very simple graphic, just to highlight the holiday.
**Mcalcetero**: You know those are not our employees, right?
**Ataylor**: No, I did not know that.
**Ataylor**: So we can change that photo.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: Who are these people?
**Mcalcetero**: Looks like steel, guys.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, that's a little master steel.
**Ataylor**: Oh, okay.
**Ataylor**: That's good to know.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so we'll make sure that the photo is.
**Ataylor**: And I'll work with Maria to make sure.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: So how does the caption look?
**Mcalcetero**: Fine.
**Ataylor**: Okay, finish that photo up and then move on.
**Ataylor**: So now I'm going to share this next, next video with you.
**Speaker 5**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: Hit it.
**Ataylor**: Do you say hit it or hate it?
**Bclymer**: Oh, just play it, Annik.
**Mcalcetero**: Common thing is people think it's more expensive.
**Mcalcetero**: People don't wrap their head around the idea of designing to a budget.
**Mcalcetero**: You know, they.
**Mcalcetero**: I don't know why.
**Mcalcetero**: I mean, anything else that you look at, right?
**Mcalcetero**: Like, if you're going to do any kind of business, you're going to back into a number.
**Mcalcetero**: Like, okay, like, what is my minimum viable product to be, you know, active and making money?
**Mcalcetero**: Well, we do the same thing.
**Mcalcetero**: We say, what is it that you need to be operational to turn a profit?
**Mcalcetero**: Let's back into that number on your performer and then build what you need.
**Speaker 5**: I think it's great.
**Mcalcetero**: I can't.
**Mcalcetero**: I can't hear, like, it.
**Mcalcetero**: Like, it sounded like the.
**Ataylor**: Is the music too Loud.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I was going to say that if you can put a little bit.
**Bclymer**: The music, the background music a little bit lower because it.
**Bclymer**: It's just me with Brandon's voice.
**Bclymer**: But other than that, I think it's good too.
**Ataylor**: All right.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, absolutely.
**Jdawson**: Sweet background.
**Ataylor**: You like the background music?
**Ataylor**: That's good.
**Jdawson**: Props to whoever recorded it.
**Ataylor**: Oh, yeah, that's true, that's true.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: If you adjust the volume because there was one part in there, like, and I couldn't hear it.
**Mcalcetero**: But yeah, like, what I said wasn't what showed up on the screen.
**Mcalcetero**: As far as the word.
**Ataylor**: Okay, I can double check that.
**Ataylor**: Everything should be correct, but I will double check it and I will also edit the volume and levels.
**Ataylor**: No problem.
**Ataylor**: Okay, let's look at the caption.
**Bclymer**: You know what?
**Bclymer**: I think the link to that one, we should.
**Bclymer**: We should send it to.
**Bclymer**: There is a blog post of Brandon talking about leader group in general and you know, how they operate.
**Bclymer**: So if you go to our articles on the website, you will see all those blog posts from Brandon already as a magazine.
**Bclymer**: So we can link it to one of those.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Because he's talking about that in the.
**Bclymer**: In the articles.
**Ataylor**: Okay, gotcha.
**Ataylor**: I will confirm with you which one, but I'll look through there to make sure we can tag to one of them.
**Mcalcetero**: Scroll back down to the verbiage.
**Mcalcetero**: So you say a lot of people think design build is more expensive.
**Mcalcetero**: The truth, we design to your budget from the start.
**Mcalcetero**: So I would almost pose it as a front end question.
**Speaker 4**: So.
**Mcalcetero**: I wouldn't ever buy something without knowing how much it costs.
**Mcalcetero**: So why would you do that for a building or something like that?
**Mcalcetero**: You know, like, because, you know, the whole, like, if you think about this, like, the truth, like, we design to your budget from the start.
**Mcalcetero**: Well, architects and engineers are going to say the same thing.
**Mcalcetero**: They just aren't as good at it, you know, because they don't have the building side of things.
**Mcalcetero**: Right.
**Mcalcetero**: I mean, we had a call this morning about a build out.
**Mcalcetero**: And you know, the first thing I did was like, why do you have this, this, this and this that you don't need?
**Mcalcetero**: Like, well, you know, the flow is better.
**Mcalcetero**: Like, oh, okay, well, you're gonna pay for the flow.
**Ataylor**: Okay, gotcha, Gotcha.
**Ataylor**: So I'm just looking.
**Ataylor**: I'm just in my copy mode.
**Ataylor**: So I'm just looking.
**Ataylor**: You can buy something free of metric cost.
**Ataylor**: So I would complete that building.
**Mcalcetero**: And then your hashtags.
**Mcalcetero**: I don't know why you would save retail space.
**Ataylor**: My thought was just having like, A general industry hashtag there.
**Mcalcetero**: I mean, you can say commercial construction.
**Ataylor**: Right, Right.
**Ataylor**: Commercial construction.
**Mcalcetero**: Now, you wouldn't say design, build, construction.
**Mcalcetero**: Commercial construction, I don't think.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so you don't want to have more than one industry hashtag.
**Mcalcetero**: Like, no, I'm fine with having multiple industry hashtags.
**Mcalcetero**: It's just construction.
**Mcalcetero**: And then commercial construction is double.
**Mcalcetero**: Like, why would you say the same thing?
**Ataylor**: Like, oh, I see.
**Ataylor**: You see them.
**Ataylor**: It's the same thing.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: I mean, it just shows up on different areas, so it can push to different outlets.
**Ataylor**: So even though they kind of mean the same thing.
**Ataylor**: Like, you could put hashtag puppy, hashtag dog, hashtag doggo.
**Ataylor**: Right.
**Ataylor**: And they choose different hashtags.
**Mcalcetero**: So then in that case, like, I would do hashtag real estate development.
**Mcalcetero**: You know, like real estate and then real estate development stuff.
**Mcalcetero**: Like.
**Mcalcetero**: Because, I mean, at the end of the day.
**Mcalcetero**: Right.
**Mcalcetero**: Who do we want to see this?
**Mcalcetero**: Do I care if other design builders and other commercial construction guys see it?
**Mcalcetero**: No, I want clients to see it.
**Mcalcetero**: That's going to be real estate developers.
**Mcalcetero**: You know, things like that.
**Mcalcetero**: Like our actual target audience.
**Ataylor**: Gotcha.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: So that's a great one to add.
**Ataylor**: And then that one is definitely a strong hashtag.
**Ataylor**: I want to check that one.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: So how do you feel about this beginning leading we already had.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, that's good.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: All right, so moving on to this one.
**Ataylor**: This is the Goodwill Foundation's office.
**Ataylor**: Information and stuff that Maria sent over earlier.
**Ataylor**: So these are the photos.
**Ataylor**: I put them, since they're a little bit there, I put them into a collage this month.
**Ataylor**: Features orange very strongly, which is color.
**Ataylor**: So it's a good thing.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so here is the caption.
**Ataylor**: You can read through it.
**Mcalcetero**: Who gave you that description?
**Ataylor**: This is the description was just information that Maria sent over and then I wrote it into.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, so.
**Bclymer**: So the pictures were.
**Bclymer**: Glenn send us those updates or context for the pictures.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, but the description, like, where it says what, like failed trusses, upgrading, finishes.
**Bclymer**: That was Glenn.
**Bclymer**: Glenn sent that to me.
**Bclymer**: He gave me context of it.
**Mcalcetero**: That makes sense.
**Mcalcetero**: Failed trusses, huh?
**Mcalcetero**: So the building is falling down.
**Mcalcetero**: Jesus Christ.
**Mcalcetero**: That needs to be reworked.
**Mcalcetero**: Okay, I don't know about the project, but that's a.
**Ataylor**: This is a shitty description.
**Ataylor**: Okay, good.
**Ataylor**: So, Maria, you and I can chat about.
**Ataylor**: Yes.
**Ataylor**: The best way to talk about exactly what's happening in the technical side of the building.
**Mcalcetero**: Reach out to Jesse R. See if he knows more about it.
**Bclymer**: Okay, I'll make sure he's actually there.
**Ataylor**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: Okay, great.
**Jdawson**: I'm not sure we had any structural on that job.
**Ataylor**: That's.
**Mcalcetero**: That's what I'm saying.
**Jdawson**: Like, I don't know why that would have been.
**Jdawson**: That would have been an aspire job.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, I don't think we did either.
**Mcalcetero**: But I mean, I don't know enough about it.
**Jdawson**: We did have like remediation on it.
**Jdawson**: It's about all I know.
**Mcalcetero**: Like saying upgrading finishes with quartz and polished concrete, like it just sounds odd.
**Ataylor**: Like.
**Jdawson**: You could probably just say just upgrading finishes.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, I mean the whole thing just, you know, needs to be.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Speaker 4**: Joists on that job that were.
**Mcalcetero**: Four joists is not trust.
**Speaker 4**: Right.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Maria and I will figure that out so that everything is very solid.
**Ataylor**: Okay, this is the post that features Ashley.
**Ataylor**: We've got the headshot that Maria sent over.
**Ataylor**: And then I'd like to customize this a little bit so that we know exactly, just so there's a little more personalized information on here.
**Mcalcetero**: So I mean, in general, like common rule of thumb, if you have less than 10 years of experience, you don't highlight it, you know, so like if you have over 10 years of experience, like, so if you're at 10 years, like, oh, like Ashley brings over a decade of experience, blah, blah, blah, blah.
**Mcalcetero**: But like I would not say Ashley brings five years of admin and operations experience.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, we don't have to mention this.
**Mcalcetero**: Try to think of other things.
**Mcalcetero**: Right.
**Mcalcetero**: Like, you know, that are not is basic.
**Mcalcetero**: Like what it.
**Mcalcetero**: Like there's more than just like 5 years of admin experience.
**Mcalcetero**: Like, no, like you actually have traits that you bring to the table that are not just I know how to print stuff.
**Mcalcetero**: Like, you know, so think about like, okay, what are some actual things like that you're good at that you do.
**Mcalcetero**: Right.
**Mcalcetero**: And then come up with that, it can be a more personal thing.
**Ataylor**: Okay, great.
**Ataylor**: So this is sort of just a placeholder for Ashley because I don't have any information on what Ashley does yet.
**Ataylor**: So actually, could you give me a sentence or two or just some bullet points that are more authentic to you, that are less about, you know, mundane skills?
**Ataylor**: Yes, Just email that to Maria or I and then I'll put something together for you.
**Ataylor**: So it's a nice little feature.
**Speaker 5**: Okay, perfect.
**Speaker 5**: I'll make sure to send you guys an email with some information so that you could work with that.
**Ataylor**: Perfect, thank you.
**Ataylor**: Okay, great.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so this is very general caption that I may tweak depending on that information we get from Ashley.
**Ataylor**: But it just says we're excited to Add her to the team and our St. Pete location in Florida.
**Mcalcetero**: The same thing.
**Mcalcetero**: Right.
**Mcalcetero**: Like with any of your hashtags.
**Mcalcetero**: Now, knowing what that is for and what that means, every single post, you should think about what hashtag is going to get clients to look at this.
**Mcalcetero**: So everything should be something real estate and development, commercial development.
**Mcalcetero**: Like, think about those kind of hashtags.
**Ataylor**: Okay, I will make a note of that.
**Mcalcetero**: Like, the whole point of marketing is to bring money in the door like that.
**Mcalcetero**: Like, marketing is like us bragging does nothing any good.
**Mcalcetero**: The whole point is to get, you know, notoriety, build authority to where it converts to dollars.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so for the next one, this is the first graphic, what delays really cost.
**Ataylor**: So this is the one I want you to really pay attention to the information to make sure it's correct because this is something just sort of come up with.
**Ataylor**: So every week equals a dollar, like dollar slots.
**Ataylor**: So rent not collected.
**Ataylor**: Assuming that it's like that would be like.
**Ataylor**: Like a store renting a space or renting out.
**Ataylor**: Like a.
**Ataylor**: Like a. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Ataylor**: You know what I mean?
**Ataylor**: Right.
**Ataylor**: So rent out collective paying staff that operations and equipment sitting items.
**Ataylor**: So those are three things.
**Ataylor**: And then why it matters to us costs money.
**Ataylor**: And that's why you'll need plans ahead and controls the factors you can keeping projects on track.
**Ataylor**: And then here's the caption.
**Mcalcetero**: I hate that little gold thing.
**Ataylor**: Can remove the gold thing.
**Mcalcetero**: It's just too much of a buzzword.
**Mcalcetero**: On time and in budget.
**Mcalcetero**: No shit.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Too tacky.
**Ataylor**: Got it.
**Mcalcetero**: You might as well say late and over budget.
**Ataylor**: Okay, point taken.
**Ataylor**: It's not really needed anyway.
**Ataylor**: I don't think I need to really fill the space.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so how do you feel about the caption?
**Mcalcetero**: I would say.
**Mcalcetero**: I would say.
**Mcalcetero**: Instead of saying, so your investment stays on schedule, on budget.
**Mcalcetero**: I would say, so your ROI goes up.
**Speaker 5**: Great.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Okay, this looks good.
**Ataylor**: I'm going to keep looking into more real estate hashtags because I want to research and find the best ones for your audience.
**Ataylor**: So for now, don't really pay attention to the hashtags.
**Ataylor**: I'll rework them.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so your third video, you want to look at the caption first.
**Ataylor**: It says, be urgent early.
**Ataylor**: At Alito, communication isn't on.
**Ataylor**: Checking boxes that results.
**Ataylor**: And then this one.
**Ataylor**: Okay, here you go.
**Mcalcetero**: Communication is vital.
**Mcalcetero**: We have a saying here.
**Mcalcetero**: Be urgent early.
**Mcalcetero**: It's driving force.
**Mcalcetero**: So, you know, not waiting for somebody else.
**Mcalcetero**: Like, oh, you know, I called them.
**Mcalcetero**: Like, that doesn't mean anything.
**Mcalcetero**: You know, you can run all day On a treadmill, but you're not going anywhere.
**Mcalcetero**: You get paid on results, not just doing things.
**Mcalcetero**: Same thing with the volume.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I hear it, too.
**Ataylor**: Okay, I'll make sure that the volume station is fixed on all of the videos, so we may have that same issue on a couple of the ones after this.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: How about this caption?
**Ataylor**: It pretty much says the same thing the video said, just in a new way.
**Ataylor**: Amica.
**Bclymer**: Sorry to interrupt.
**Bclymer**: Jesse, are you available right now?
**Bclymer**: I'm with Georgia License application right now, and they need to or either respect to you or with Brandon authorization.
**Bclymer**: So can I call you Jesse?
**Bclymer**: Also, it has to be Brandon who's calling.
**Bclymer**: Okay, so give me one second, please.
**Mcalcetero**: Who's it need to be?
**Mcalcetero**: Me or me or Jesse?
**Bclymer**: It has to be you.
**Bclymer**: Brandon, can you.
**Bclymer**: Sorry, Anika, to interrupt.
**Bclymer**: Brandon, can you talk?
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: Just call me on teams.
**Ataylor**: Okay?
**Bclymer**: One second.
**Bclymer**: Sorry, Anika, one second.
**Ataylor**: It's okay.
**Ataylor**: We can pause.
**Ataylor**: All right.
**Ataylor**: While they do that, we can just take a quick break and just wait for them to pop back on.
**Speaker 5**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: I got my camera working.
**Jdawson**: Is it not working on your computer, Ashley?
**Speaker 5**: No, it wasn't working on my computer, so I just put it on my phone.
**Jdawson**: I've been having that problem, too.
**Speaker 5**: It was.
**Speaker 5**: I guess it was something like with the Microsoft Edge and the Google me.
**Speaker 5**: It just.
**Speaker 5**: Something happened.
**Jdawson**: You settling in down there?
**Speaker 5**: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 5**: Look, everything's going great.
**Speaker 5**: Got my setup right here.
**Speaker 5**: The printer, community printer.
**Ataylor**: Everything's going great.
**Jdawson**: Good.
**Speaker 5**: Yeah, Very exciting.
**Speaker 4**: I just emailed you back on that healthcare post.
**Ataylor**: I see that.
**Ataylor**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: I think it looks great.
**Ataylor**: And I'll make those changes.
**Ataylor**: Thanks for doing this so quickly.
**Ataylor**: What did you use to edit the PDF you sent me?
**Ataylor**: Like, oops, sorry, Mary.
**Jdawson**: We used Bluebeam.
**Jdawson**: Monica.
**Jdawson**: It's a Bluebeam.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: It's a construction one, and Jesse's a Bluebeam Wizard.
**Ataylor**: It was very fast.
**Ataylor**: That's great.
**Speaker 4**: It's very useful.
**Ataylor**: Our team is very much a Google, you know, Adobe side of the Creative Suite, all of that stuff.
**Ataylor**: So we're less familiar with things that are more ingrained to Microsoft.
**Speaker 4**: What I found is I can take almost any drawing and cut and paste it to make any other drawing I want.
**Speaker 4**: So that's what I use it mostly for.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I can see how helpful that is.
**Speaker 4**: I'd probably be better if I just learn how to do cad and then I could just draw it.
**Speaker 4**: But.
**Ataylor**: I don't know what CAD is, so.
**Ataylor**: So probably fine.
**Speaker 4**: It's got too many buttons.
**Speaker 4**: I just don't Want to learn all that again?
**Ataylor**: Is it for, like, drawing up or plans and things like that?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: You guys ever do 3D models that kind of useless.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah, it's, well, CAD and, well, it's Revit that does the 3D modeling.
**Speaker 4**: Just another drawing software.
**Ataylor**: It's a whole side of the business that I not familiar with.
**Speaker 4**: Well, we all have to pick something, get good at it, and then.
**Ataylor**: Yes, absolutely.
**Speaker 4**: I don't know anything about marketing, so there you go.
**Mcalcetero**: You're.
**Speaker 4**: I'm never taking your job.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, well, vice versa.
**Jdawson**: So what did Maria need?
**Jdawson**: Something about the Georgia license.
**Jdawson**: Jesse Dawson.
**Speaker 4**: Yeah, they were calling back.
**Speaker 4**: We're trying to upload a revision to it, but their link isn't working, so they have to manually call in.
**Mcalcetero**: So this.
**Jdawson**: Thing I need to get notarized.
**Speaker 4**: That's a different.
**Speaker 4**: It's a different document.
**Speaker 4**: We already have that they're trying to upload right now.
**Speaker 4**: That one you have is just to give Maria authorization.
**Speaker 4**: That's why she has to call Brandon every time, because they won't talk to her.
**Speaker 4**: They got to talk to brandon.
**Speaker 5**: Right.
**Speaker 5**: So, A.J.
**Speaker 5**: we're fine with getting that later this afternoon or tomorrow morning.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Can you send me, like.
**Jdawson**: Did you scan this on your computer or on your phone or on your.
**Ataylor**: Email?
**Speaker 5**: I sent you was like the image, but then I sent you the PDF via teams so you could access this.
**Speaker 5**: Access it easier.
**Jdawson**: Can you scan from that printer?
**Jdawson**: Because the.
**Jdawson**: The quality on it is not.
**Jdawson**: Did you take a picture of it to scan it?
**Speaker 5**: No, I scanned it with this printer over here.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Speaker 5**: Are you asking me to re.
**Speaker 5**: Scan it to, like, your.
**Jdawson**: You can maybe scan it?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, the quality on.
**Jdawson**: It's just like, it's really fuzzy on what you sent me, and that's gonna like, raise a red flag when we.
**Jdawson**: Since we go about our notary a little bit different.
**Speaker 5**: I'll go ahead and try to rescan it to make it look less fuzzy.
**Speaker 5**: I was hoping that once I sent it to you, it wasn't gonna look this fuzzy, but thank you for letting me know.
**Jdawson**: You, like, scan it to my email?
**Mcalcetero**: Maybe.
**Jdawson**: I don't know.
**Jdawson**: I don't know how that printer works.
**Speaker 5**: I, like, found like a third way how to scan with this printer.
**Speaker 5**: So I don't yet know how to scan to other.
**Jdawson**: What kind of printer is it?
**Speaker 5**: It's an.
**Speaker 5**: I'll send you the, like, specific name to it.
**Speaker 5**: It's just an Epson printer.
**Jdawson**: I know what.
**Jdawson**: Let me see.
**Ataylor**: What.
**Jdawson**: So Maria's at the top.
**Jdawson**: Jesse signed it.
**Jdawson**: Do we have A digital copy of this document we had to have, right?
**Speaker 5**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Why don't you send me the digital copy of the original, like, application?
**Speaker 5**: Like, it's the hard copy.
**Bclymer**: Like.
**Jdawson**: Well, I'm looking here.
**Mcalcetero**: It's like.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: So you had to print that off, though, to get Jesse to sign it, right?
**Speaker 5**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Is it fuzzy when you printed it off?
**Speaker 5**: It's a little fuzzy in the part where you notarize it, but overall, no.
**Speaker 5**: Like, let's see if I can flip the camera really fast.
**Speaker 5**: Like, it's only fuzzy right here.
**Ataylor**: But.
**Speaker 5**: Overall, it's not fuz.
**Speaker 5**: But it looks.
**Jdawson**: And send it to me like, on.
**Jdawson**: On email and see if that works.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Jesse, that's your digital signature, isn't it?
**Jdawson**: You didn't actually, like, put pen to paper on that?
**Speaker 5**: It was pen to paper.
**Jdawson**: Oh, was it actually pen to paper?
**Speaker 5**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: It's a nice signature.
**Speaker 5**: So when I scan it, I use, like, a third part.
**Speaker 5**: Like, I have to, like, go into an application to scan it, and it goes to my computer, and then I have to turn that scan scan into a PDF.
**Speaker 5**: So is.
**Jdawson**: Is that computer or that printer you should be able to scan, like, go into the printer settings, and you should have, like, a scan to option on that Epson.
**Mcalcetero**: I have one at home.
**Speaker 5**: Yeah.
**Speaker 5**: So I had done.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Speaker 5**: I had gone through it a couple times, and every time I went to go.
**Speaker 5**: Every time I went to go scan, it just said, like, invalid connection.
**Speaker 5**: And we thought it was because of the.
**Speaker 5**: We thought it was because of, like, the bad USB cord, but then we bought another USB cord because we.
**Speaker 5**: We didn't have one.
**Speaker 5**: And the USB cord doesn't work with the laptop or, like, anyone's laptop.
**Speaker 5**: Jesse and I have both tried.
**Jdawson**: Cloud scanning option.
**Jdawson**: Scan to cloud.
**Speaker 5**: Yeah, not even the cloud scan beginning will work just because it just says invalid.
**Speaker 5**: Like, I even tried rebooting the whole printer.
**Speaker 5**: I've tried.
**Speaker 5**: I've tried restarting my laptop.
**Speaker 5**: I've tried.
**Speaker 5**: I've watched several videos on this.
**Speaker 5**: At this point, I feel like I need to find, like, I need to call, like, Epson or something to have them, like, hack our printer maybe and get a connection.
**Speaker 5**: I've even restarted the WI FI on this thing.
**Speaker 5**: I, like, took it off and put it back on.
**Speaker 5**: I just don't know what else to do.
**Speaker 5**: So I just, like, use this three third party.
**Jdawson**: Sounds like you guys need to fly your resident company IT guy down.
**Speaker 5**: Andrew.
**Speaker 5**: I think probably it's.
**Jdawson**: It's actually me.
**Speaker 5**: Oh.
**Ataylor**: Just didn't know that.
**Jdawson**: Maybe Andrew, too.
**Jdawson**: A Little bit.
**Speaker 5**: I thought Andrew was our IT guy.
**Jdawson**: He's our computer setter.
**Jdawson**: Upper.
**Speaker 5**: Gotcha.
**Jdawson**: I was making a joke because it's cold up here in Indy.
**Jdawson**: Now I need to get down to.
**Jdawson**: I need to get down to the St. Pete office.
**Speaker 5**: In the office.
**Jdawson**: I'll try with this and.
**Jdawson**: And see how it prints out.
**Speaker 5**: Well, I was gonna say, can I just stand.
**Speaker 5**: Like, by any chance, can you take that scanned image and form it into a PDF on your Adobe?
**Speaker 5**: Because I tried with my Adobe, but it.
**Speaker 5**: It didn't work because that's the final PDF that came out fuzzy.
**Ataylor**: Print this here at our printer.
**Speaker 5**: See, I literally just, like, put it on there, and then on my laptop, I click scan.
**Speaker 5**: So it's like scanning right now.
**Ataylor**: But.
**Jdawson**: You'Re not scanning it through the.
**Jdawson**: Through the.
**Jdawson**: You don't feed it into the printer, do you?
**Speaker 5**: I don't think it feeds.
**Speaker 5**: The printer doesn't send it into my laptop.
**Speaker 5**: My laptop pretty much feeds.
**Speaker 5**: Feeds it off the printer, if that makes sense.
**Speaker 5**: Like, the printer doesn't do much.
**Speaker 5**: It just scans it.
**Speaker 5**: But my.
**Speaker 5**: My computer, like, this third party, pretty much grabs it from the printer.
**Ataylor**: Interesting.
**Speaker 5**: Maybe I'm missing something.
**Speaker 5**: Fingers crossed.
**Mcalcetero**: I think it sounds like you guys.
**Jdawson**: Just need a new printer down there.
**Speaker 5**: But the thing is, it's brand new.
**Speaker 5**: Jesse just got it from Costco.
**Speaker 5**: Costco?
**Speaker 5**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: I just printed this off.
**Jdawson**: We'll see what it looks like.
**Ataylor**: It.
**Jdawson**: We'll just see what it looks like.
**Speaker 5**: Okay?
**Jdawson**: Not a big deal.
**Ataylor**: Wait, let me try one.
**Ataylor**: It's.
**Ataylor**: It.
**Jdawson**: See, Ashley, this is what messes up on my.
**Jdawson**: On my camera.
**Jdawson**: Look, you see me with pink hair.
**Speaker 5**: You look the same.
**Speaker 5**: Aj to be honest.
**Jdawson**: Maybe in another life.
**Speaker 5**: Oh, God.
**Speaker 5**: Wait.
**Speaker 5**: You can easily fix that, I think, in your settings, like, at the bottom.
**Jdawson**: I don't know.
**Jdawson**: It, like, forgets that I have an internal camera, and then it adds this avatar on there.
**Speaker 5**: It has to be something in your settings that you could easily turn off.
**Speaker 5**: Honestly, it's a great avatar.
**Ataylor**: It's party.
**Speaker 5**: Anika, are you still there?
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I'm here.
**Ataylor**: Hi.
**Speaker 5**: I have a quick question I was wondering if you can ask me, like, what exactly and what information did you want from me to help with the post?
**Ataylor**: So it would be anything related to your work experience or what you're interested in and what you are looking to do at Alito or things like that?
**Ataylor**: And then you could, if you wanted to, include something, you know, like, I have a dog.
**Ataylor**: I love my dog.
**Ataylor**: Or, you know, something.
**Ataylor**: Something.
**Speaker 5**: Okay, sounds good.
**Speaker 5**: Something like just personal Just like very direct.
**Speaker 5**: Similar to the one like I think Jesse had.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, exactly.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Speaker 5**: Because I read Jesse's right before I started.
**Speaker 5**: So now I have a little bit of an idea.
**Ataylor**: Okay, perfect.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, it's not anything crazy.
**Speaker 5**: Okay, sounds good.
**Speaker 5**: Thank you.
**Speaker 5**: I just wanted to clarify.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, no problem.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, it should be very simple.
**Speaker 5**: Awesome.
**Speaker 5**: And great.
**Speaker 5**: Then I'll go ahead and send you.
**Speaker 5**: I'll go ahead and create that and then send you an email with Maria as well for all of us to review.
**Ataylor**: Okay, that's perfect.
**Ataylor**: Thanks, Ash.
**Speaker 5**: Great.
**Ataylor**: It.
**Ataylor**: It's.
**Ataylor**: It.
**Mcalcetero**: All right, what's next?
**Jdawson**: You guys get it figured out?
**Mcalcetero**: Yep.
**Bclymer**: Yes, we fixed that.
**Ataylor**: We have.
**Ataylor**: I have to yell the lady.
**Ataylor**: I'm glad that you got that figured out.
**Ataylor**: Okay, let me get back into this.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so we looked at video three, I believe.
**Ataylor**: I believe so.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so next we're just going right into video four.
**Ataylor**: We also have another project highlight, but I know that we're going to chat about what project later.
**Ataylor**: Okay, here is the next video.
**Mcalcetero**: If they don't have an office dog, don't work with them.
**Mcalcetero**: No.
**Mcalcetero**: So what would I tell any owner is a red flag to watch out for.
**Mcalcetero**: The biggest thing I would say is that when, you know, clients oftentimes are pennywise and pound foolish.
**Mcalcetero**: And so what they'll do is they'll look at the upfront cost, right?
**Mcalcetero**: If you're going into a building and it's like, oh, it's $10 million, like, and they look at that number and there's another guy that's $8 million or $9 million or whatever that is, and they look at that.
**Mcalcetero**: But what they're not realizing is, okay, what is my business going to produce, you know, a month that it's open, right?
**Mcalcetero**: So they forget the time component.
**Mcalcetero**: So if your business is truly profitable and you want to get it open to make money as fast as possible, then you have to calculate that.
**Mcalcetero**: Because for every month that you're late, it's costing you money.
**Ataylor**: Money.
**Mcalcetero**: And so if you're going to have your business for 5, 10, 15, 20 years, you have to think about, alright, so how much am I going to make?
**Mcalcetero**: How efficient can my operation be by using the proper design and materials?
**Mcalcetero**: And then take that into account, not just looking at the upfront number and thinking like, oh, well, I've got to get this done as cheap as possible, because over the course of 10 or 15 years, it won't be as cheap as possible.
**Ataylor**: Okay, there you go.
**Ataylor**: Bit of a longer one.
**Ataylor**: I also think it took a While for the music to get come in.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, I think the volume is still an issue.
**Ataylor**: Oh, yeah, I agree.
**Ataylor**: It'll need to.
**Ataylor**: We'll need to look at them across each video and make sure that they are balanced.
**Ataylor**: Okay, here's the caption.
**Ataylor**: Oh, wait, you can't see this.
**Ataylor**: Here's the caption.
**Ataylor**: It.
**Ataylor**: Okay, the next one is the second graphic.
**Ataylor**: The idea behind this one is just unifying your team as you know, what sets you apart.
**Ataylor**: Design builds being one team, one contract, one group or one.
**Ataylor**: The arrow is.
**Ataylor**: So it's a carousel.
**Ataylor**: So it's for the swiping purpose.
**Mcalcetero**: Gotcha.
**Ataylor**: So it starts with this one.
**Ataylor**: And then traditional builds have too many players, so there's no construction.
**Mcalcetero**: I mean, that's not accurate.
**Mcalcetero**: I mean, you have the same amount of players whether it's design to build or design build.
**Mcalcetero**: Like, you know, I mean, the only difference is who's.
**Mcalcetero**: Who's in the lead, right?
**Mcalcetero**: And where you're starting and how you're planning, you know, because, I mean, when we do design build, it doesn't mean there's no architect.
**Mcalcetero**: It just means that, you know, they work for us and we, you know, keep everything moving and guide them along the way.
**Ataylor**: Okay, gotcha.
**Ataylor**: So I'll rephrase that intro title so that it's not misleading.
**Ataylor**: What about the second part with a separate designer and builder contracts, conflicting priorities and budget surprises late in the game.
**Ataylor**: Does that sound accurate?
**Mcalcetero**: I mean, you know, the issue, you know, is really the design bid build world when it comes to between the builder and the designers, the finger pointing game, right?
**Mcalcetero**: So, you know, you know, your client sends us out, says, hey, bid this, right?
**Mcalcetero**: Like, well, all right, I'm gonna bid exactly what's on those drawings.
**Mcalcetero**: And then when we get into the building, and I'm like, hey, you know, the owner's like, wait a minute, there's supposed to be this, this and this here.
**Mcalcetero**: It's like, well, that's not on these drawings.
**Mcalcetero**: It's like, well, that, that's what I. I wanted.
**Mcalcetero**: Blah, blah.
**Mcalcetero**: And so then it's like, well, what do you want me to do?
**Mcalcetero**: It's not on the drawing.
**Mcalcetero**: And you know, some designers be like, well, you should have known.
**Mcalcetero**: Like, should have known, like, what the are you talking about?
**Speaker 5**: Gotcha.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so I can get to that, to the meat and potatoes of that of the figure pointing game and kind of redo this slide.
**Ataylor**: So for the design build aspect, one.
**Mcalcetero**: Aligned to, I mean, the biggest, the biggest thing I would say, if you wanted to think about like, you know, a graphic for that.
**Mcalcetero**: Like what design bid build is.
**Mcalcetero**: You could almost have, like, two people pushing and saying, like, fault.
**Mcalcetero**: You know, your fault, your fault.
**Mcalcetero**: Right.
**Mcalcetero**: Versus design.
**Mcalcetero**: Design build is both of them point on the rope in the same direction.
**Mcalcetero**: You know, one team.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Like that.
**Ataylor**: Those two visuals.
**Ataylor**: You've mentioned that before.
**Ataylor**: Two people pulling on the rope in the same direction.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so what about the copy on the second slide?
**Ataylor**: Single point of accountability, Budget and design online from day one.
**Ataylor**: And faster delivery fe fewer change orders.
**Mcalcetero**: Yep.
**Ataylor**: Okay, then this final slide, the power of one with Alito, you just.
**Ataylor**: You don't just get a builder.
**Ataylor**: You get a partner who delivers results to that pencil.
**Mcalcetero**: I would say instead of the power of one, like the power of an owner's mindset.
**Ataylor**: Kind of like that.
**Ataylor**: Okay, here's the caption, and I can rephrase it to be a little bit more.
**Mcalcetero**: You say, like traditional construction splits design and build into two, separate.
**Mcalcetero**: Into separate contracts.
**Ataylor**: Like.
**Mcalcetero**: Splits design and.
**Ataylor**: In traditional construction design.
**Ataylor**: And they'll often end up, you know, pointing the finger at each other about changes and things like that.
**Ataylor**: I can.
**Ataylor**: I can make it geared towards what you were.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah, just update it, and we'll look at it when you get it updated.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Speaker 5**: So.
**Ataylor**: Excuse me.
**Speaker 5**: So.
**Ataylor**: Five to look at, and then, like, number five and then number six, and then we've got one project highlight that we'll do later.
**Ataylor**: So we'll do this video first.
**Mcalcetero**: It'd be great if clients, you know, asked, what are my expectations for, you know, timeline?
**Mcalcetero**: Right.
**Mcalcetero**: Is this realistic?
**Mcalcetero**: Is what I want realistic?
**Mcalcetero**: And look at it that way, thinking, like, what are some things that you see could be issues with this project?
**Mcalcetero**: And just, you know, that's the education part that I see.
**Mcalcetero**: I mean, if I'm building a building, that's questions I would ask.
**Mcalcetero**: I would want to know those things.
**Mcalcetero**: I could really hear it.
**Ataylor**: But, yeah, I'm gonna go through and optimize the quality before I put in the.
**Ataylor**: The music, just to make sure that your voice is crisp and loud.
**Ataylor**: I have a nice software that I like to do that in, so I'll go through and do that for each of them.
**Ataylor**: And then if you want, I can make sure that you see these again before they go out, just to make sure.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so the caption is here.
**Ataylor**: Sorry, did you say something?
**Mcalcetero**: I said, yeah, you know, obviously, just make sure that they do before they go out.
**Ataylor**: Yes.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: I don't know.
**Mcalcetero**: I mean, it's hard for me to make comment on the caption because I couldn't hear what I was saying, and I don't remember.
**Ataylor**: Gotcha.
**Ataylor**: All right, well, we can come back to these.
**Ataylor**: These are later in the month, too, so we can always look at them during our next meeting, especially since we're butting up against the end of the hour here, a little over.
**Ataylor**: I mean, the last one is similar in terms of the audio, but it's on.
**Ataylor**: It's just about that sixth question you answered.
**Ataylor**: I'll play it quick for you so you can get a visual and then we can just look at it later.
**Mcalcetero**: When you look at building a building.
**Mcalcetero**: Right, so take your MEPs, for instance.
**Mcalcetero**: You can do high efficiency, meaning, hey, I'm going to hold this building building for a really long time, and so I need a really high efficiency system so that my energy costs are low over time.
**Mcalcetero**: I'm gonna get some tax credits or, hey, I'm gonna build this and I'm going to turn around.
**Mcalcetero**: Either lease it all out and the tenant has to pay all that stuff, so I don't care what it costs, or I'm gonna just sell it and somebody else has to deal with it.
**Mcalcetero**: So then you're looking at.
**Mcalcetero**: All right, well, what's the, you know, most cost effective approach that we can take on that?
**Mcalcetero**: So those are a couple things that you look at.
**Mcalcetero**: Instead of just arbitrarily, oh, we're going to take out a unit or this, that the other, like, figure out what the end goal is for the exit strategy.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Mcalcetero**: Yeah.
**Mcalcetero**: What was the question?
**Ataylor**: It was about value engineering.
**Ataylor**: How do you ensure quality?
**Ataylor**: Value engineering.
**Ataylor**: I believe that's it.
**Ataylor**: I have to read it.
**Ataylor**: Exactly.
**Ataylor**: How do you balance value engineering and quality?
**Mcalcetero**: Good.
**Ataylor**: All right, so I'll make sure that you see these again, and I'll get those audios optimized so that they are nice and nice and loud and balanced with the music.
**Ataylor**: Okay, so that's pretty much it for today, except.
**Ataylor**: Sorry, let me go back to our call agenda because we do have a look at.
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Annika, so Jesse send you the notes for the anatomy of the healthcare.
**Ataylor**: Did you see them?
**Ataylor**: Yes, I did see them.
**Ataylor**: We chatted while you guys were on that other call.
**Ataylor**: So we're good there.
**Ataylor**: Let's see.
**Ataylor**: We can also look at.
**Ataylor**: We have a lot.
**Ataylor**: We had a lot to go over today.
**Ataylor**: So we can look at this deck that I sent over a while ago.
**Ataylor**: If you want to, we can look at it together during our next call.
**Ataylor**: Or, you know, that's just a reminder that that's there for you to look at if you'd like to.
**Ataylor**: Also, while you guys were off the call, I started looking into some real estate development hashtags that are out there on LinkedIn that are trending and people are using.
**Ataylor**: But I'm going to send you a bigger email with those with a better list and then you can kind of look at it and see which ones are your favorite.
**Ataylor**: Let's see.
**Ataylor**: Okay, I think that's it for today.
**Ataylor**: Oh, the Q3 newsletter.
**Ataylor**: I'll be sending out before the end of the week so that we can get that sent out as well.
**Ataylor**: That's just a reminder.
**Ataylor**: And our next meeting will be September 8th at 2pm unless anyone would like to change the time.
**Ataylor**: Perfect.
**Ataylor**: Awesome.
**Bclymer**: And Anika, let's just get in touch, you and me, so we can fix all the things that the guys need from the captions and pictures and everything.
**Ataylor**: Okay?
**Ataylor**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: That sounds perfect.
**Ataylor**: Thank you all for your time and we'll talk soon.
**Bclymer**: Sounds good.
**Bclymer**: Thank you, Annika.
**Jdawson**: Hey, guys.
