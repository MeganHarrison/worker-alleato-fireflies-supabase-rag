**Aortiz**: I don't know if he still uses Apple products, but I'm still curious.

**Speaker 1**: Okay, let's go ahead through these ones.
**Speaker 1**: In the meantime, I will say to order.
**Speaker 1**: AI.
**Speaker 1**: Have you ever used Otter AI?
**Speaker 1**: That's good.
**Speaker 1**: I've used it in the past for when you are recording or anything.
**Speaker 1**: It immediately creates the transcript, you know, of the voice.
**Speaker 1**: So that's good.
**Speaker 1**: But I don't think we might need it to be honest.
**Speaker 1**: Copy AI.
**Speaker 1**: Content creation and copywriting, design and images.
**Speaker 1**: Maybe this one AI for us if we want to start doing something for marketing.
**Aortiz**: Yeah.

**Aortiz**: I was doing some research on like notion.
**Aortiz**: Like I know like on Outlook you have like the options of planner and I've been using it for like my to do list, everything like that.
**Aortiz**: But I should like I. I did on chat gbt and they were mentioning how notion AI is more beneficial and works that works better because like you can share it, other people can see it and then you can also take longer note taking on it too.
**Speaker 1**: Wow, that's nice.
**Aortiz**: Yeah.
**Aortiz**: So I'm going to try it out today.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So I want to see this one, the one that says notion.
**Speaker 1**: This one motion.

**Aortiz**: I was having that too.
**Speaker 1**: How do you fix it?
**Aortiz**: I. I just.
**Aortiz**: It was like something that was in my activity and Then it went away.

**Speaker 1**: So we said Leonardo AI.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: So we said for productivity and workflow.
**Speaker 1**: So we're going to try this one.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: So instead of marketing tools, this is going to be productivity, right?
**Speaker 1**: Yes, we can have this one.
**Speaker 1**: Perfect.
**Speaker 1**: Now for research and agents, I see when marketing utilities remove the cleanup pictures.
**Speaker 1**: Nah.
**Speaker 1**: But what are your student or creator, developer or.
**Speaker 1**: So there are some here Medium blog posts.
**Speaker 1**: Well, but here in the share they're completely hundred.
**Speaker 1**: Use a full Cure.
**Speaker 1**: At least 100 tools for a medium blog spot.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, let's see.
**Speaker 1**: Jasper.
**Speaker 1**: I've used Jasper and I don't like it, to be honest.
**Speaker 1**: It's been okay.
**Speaker 1**: It's not very intuitive.
**Speaker 1**: For design, copy AI writesonic.com anywhere.com content creation and copywriting, design and images.
**Speaker 1**: Well, Canva.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Have you ever used Canva?

**Speaker 1**: Oh my God.
**Speaker 1**: It's just.
**Aortiz**: Should we start using it again?
**Speaker 1**: Canva AI or mid Journey.
**Speaker 1**: We never use it here.
**Speaker 1**: I've used it in the past.
**Speaker 1**: I mean with previous company.
**Aortiz**: Yeah, I'm sure we can start using it.
**Aortiz**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Hotpot AI Remove Biggie.
**Speaker 1**: No, but remove it.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, that's super easy to find.
**Speaker 1**: Online video edit.
**Speaker 1**: This is the part that we need.
**Speaker 1**: Video editing and creation.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, this is the one that he was talking about.
**Speaker 1**: Discript.com?
**Aortiz**: Yes, we should look at the one above that too.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So get a recording to edit, upload or paste a YouTube link.
**Speaker 1**: Give me one second.
**Speaker 1**: One second.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Thank you.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, perfect.
**Speaker 1**: Sorry Ash, I'm back.
**Aortiz**: No worries.
**Speaker 1**: Anyway, so.
**Speaker 1**: So that this one is the one that Brandon was talking about and I think that's good.
**Speaker 1**: So this group is fine.
**Speaker 1**: So let's add it here and I'm only Journey.
**Speaker 1**: So let's add this script to our list together.
**Speaker 1**: For marketing.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: Or for productivity yeah, she's here.
**Speaker 1**: Did you hear her?
**Aortiz**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: Crying or.
**Aortiz**: Not very little.
**Aortiz**: Hola.
**Speaker 1**: It was like, Hola.
**Speaker 1**: Anyway, okay, so let's use this, this.
**Speaker 1**: This script.
**Speaker 1**: What was the other one?
**Speaker 1**: Victory.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: Text to video.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, wow, that looks cool.
**Speaker 1**: Text to video.
**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Aortiz**: So I'm.
**Aortiz**: I'm still, like, following along with what you and Brandon are wanting for, like, the videos.
**Aortiz**: So he mentioned that he wanted, like, how to videos just for resources.
**Aortiz**: But are these videos also, like, for social media?
**Speaker 1**: So.
**Speaker 1**: No.
**Speaker 1**: So we have two different type of things.
**Speaker 1**: So the videos for social media, I usually ask the guys, like, hey, guys, we're going to record, for example, the day of the life of a construction, you know, partner or superintendent.
**Aortiz**: So.
**Speaker 1**: So I asked them personally, and they are like, oh, sure, Maria, I can send it to you.
**Speaker 1**: Or sometimes they're.
**Speaker 1**: Maria, I don't have time.
**Speaker 1**: But those are collected, like, individually.
**Speaker 1**: And then for the how to, for example, job planner, can you.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, yeah, it's just pictures I can see.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So, for example, job planner or poker, they usually have a lot of things to do that the guys are not very aware of.
**Speaker 1**: So Brandon is the person kind of like testing those things, and he's just, like, letting the team know, like, hey, guys, in order to do that, just go here, go there.
**Speaker 1**: But it's kind of difficult for him to explain it very well.
**Speaker 1**: So what he does is just like there's another app that he used that actually you create a video and then when you are like, mentioning, for example, when you say go to the menu, so it creates an arrow for you instead of you actually manually going and go here.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
**Speaker 1**: So if you say go to the menu and then click to the right, so the video kind of like follows your void in the interface.
**Speaker 1**: So it kind of creates everything.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, that's really.
**Aortiz**: I think.
**Aortiz**: Is.
**Aortiz**: Is it the one that Jesse is working on right now?
**Speaker 1**: Yes, I think that's the one.
**Speaker 1**: Yes.
**Aortiz**: Yeah, Yeah.
**Aortiz**: I helped Jesse, like, use his, like, camera and speaker last week, and I think he was just telling me this morning how he was just now recording a video.
**Speaker 1**: That's good.
**Speaker 1**: That's actually.
**Speaker 1**: I think that's the one they want to use.
**Speaker 1**: So that's super cool, you know?
**Aortiz**: Yes.
**Speaker 1**: Okay, great.
**Speaker 1**: Thank you.
**Speaker 1**: Oh, I've tried Opus Pro, and it's not good at all.
**Speaker 1**: It's really bad.
**Speaker 1**: It's clipping the reel that is creating.
**Speaker 1**: For example, you want to mention something about, I don't know, a specific design, and it just.
**Speaker 1**: Yeah, clips, like a bunch of mini reels.
**Speaker 1**: But with no meaning at all.

**Speaker 1**: Synthesia.
**Speaker 1**: I've used it in the past too.

**Speaker 1**: Okay.
**Speaker 1**: So look how you can see this.
**Speaker 1**: So if you want somebody to.

**Speaker 1**: You definitely can tell.
**Speaker 1**: So I think it's good.
**Speaker 1**: But it's still.
**Speaker 1**: It's missing a lot of details.
**Speaker 1**: So you can see.
**Speaker 1**: You know, I've used it in the past too, and I don't like it.
**Speaker 1**: The feel of it, the expression of the face.
**Speaker 1**: They're not.
**Aortiz**: It doesn't seem too authentic.
**Aortiz**: It seems to copy paste.
**Speaker 1**: And I was saying what happened if I want to add a logo in their shirts, you know, or something like that.
**Speaker 1**: And it's not possible because I. I suppose I want to add them as part of the company.
**Speaker 1**: Right.
**Speaker 1**: And they're like, no, just so it's a little bit difficult.
**Speaker 1**: I didn't like it at all, if you want me to be honest.
