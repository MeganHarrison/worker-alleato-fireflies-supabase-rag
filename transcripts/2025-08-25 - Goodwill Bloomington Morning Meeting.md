## Transcript
**Jcurtin**: What's going on with Rick?
**Jdawson**: I haven't heard from him today at all again, but nothing.
**Jdawson**: Nothing out of the ordinary for them.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, and they're supposed to be there pouring this morning under that canopy, right?
**Jdawson**: Well, they never said this morning.
**Jdawson**: They just said Monday and then they never gave me a time.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so then this morning I was trying to track down when they scheduled it for today so I could get more of an idea because, remember, me and you talked about how cornering.
**Jdawson**: I don't know if cornering them in is the right analogy right now, but you know what I mean.
**Jdawson**: About as far as getting exact times of like.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so when do you plan on pouring concrete?
**Jcurtin**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, yeah, trying to do that, but I haven't gotten the answers yet.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: And then Nick wasn't included on that email you sent to Heather, so I forwarded it to him, but I just got it a few minutes ago.
**Jcurtin**: I thought I blind copied both of.
**Bclymer**: Y' all email, actually.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I thought I blind copied both of y'.
**Jcurtin**: All.
**Jcurtin**: Oh, I didn't realize you blind copied us.
**Jcurtin**: I'm sorry.
**Jcurtin**: Oh, yeah, you're good.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Nick, have you tried to get a hold of him at all?
**Bclymer**: No.
**Jcurtin**: Can you try give him a call?
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Put a message in the team's chat and then if he doesn't call you, I'll try him.
**Jcurtin**: Have we heard anything from United?
**Jdawson**: I haven't yet, no.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Nick.
**Jcurtin**: Of you.
**Bclymer**: Well, we had the plan on Friday that they were going to come in, I think tomorrow.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: And then, didn't we?
**Bclymer**: Well, that's depending on if Rick pours that concrete.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, that's.
**Jcurtin**: That's what I mean.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Oh, yeah.
**Jdawson**: Did we find out there was some like, contract verbiage we were going back and forth with how we only saw 48 hours notice, but do we actually do have obligation to kind of bring in another guy without having to actually wait 48 hours?
**Bclymer**: Hi, Rick.
**Bclymer**: Hey, how's it going?
**Bclymer**: Yes, Morning.
**Bclymer**: Are you guys pouring that slab today on Bloomington?
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: All right.
**Bclymer**: Just wanted to check on it.
**Jcurtin**: See if you can get a time.
**Jcurtin**: Get a time.
**Bclymer**: And then the morning or do you know, more time?
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: All right, thanks, Rick.
**Jcurtin**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Rick said he.
**Bclymer**: He's not pouring today.
**Bclymer**: He said, hey, he's gonna pour tomorrow.
**Jcurtin**: Maybe he's gonna pour tomorrow.
**Bclymer**: No, he.
**Bclymer**: He said he has it scheduled for tomorrow.
**Jcurtin**: What?
**Jcurtin**: Did he say what time the trucks are coming?
**Bclymer**: He said around 10am okay.
**Jcurtin**: What does that do to us?
**Bclymer**: We need a.
**Jdawson**: I guess that affects when we give him the Notice.
**Jcurtin**: But.
**Jdawson**: Now we can't give it to him until tomorrow.
**Bclymer**: We.
**Bclymer**: We have to try to reschedule things with United States.
**Jcurtin**: Did.
**Jdawson**: So do you remember on Friday when we were trying to see if we had enough contract verbiage to where we can bring in somebody before the 48 hours?
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Yes.
**Jcurtin**: I don't think we have that language.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I don't think we do.
**Jdawson**: Oh, so what are we going to do?
**Jcurtin**: But should we get a hold of Zach from United States?
**Bclymer**: Let me add them on this.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: And Jesse, Jesse Dawson was saying that he just wants to bring United in, like even before the 48 hours.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: So he's cool with just, just bringing United in.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay, let me add United onto this call.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: He's not answering, but when I, when I hear back from him, I'll let you guys know.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: So sequence wise, where does that going to land us in terms of the inspection?
**Jcurtin**: None of the exterior stuff we're doing has anything to do with the tco.
**Jcurtin**: Correct.
**Bclymer**: Well, I think we need the striping.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we need the pavement and the striping.
**Jcurtin**: Oh, yeah, we need.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, we need that temp striping.
**Jcurtin**: Can we still do noon on Thursday for the inspection?
**Jcurtin**: If that guy pours at 10am tomorrow?
**Jdawson**: Zach, what happened?
**Bclymer**: I don't think so.
**Jdawson**: I don't think so.
**Jdawson**: We may have to look into pushing this to Friday.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: And Zach's coming.
**Jcurtin**: Planning to come tomorrow or tomorrow and Wednesday for tape and.
**Jcurtin**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Per the Friday conversation.
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Jcurtin**: But.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, but if he, if he comes tomorrow, he's coming after that concrete is poured, right?
**Jdawson**: Well, he can't.
**Jcurtin**: He'd have to.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, we just have to make sure we clarify that with him to not show up at like 7, because we're not.
**Jdawson**: We're not pouring that today anymore.
**Bclymer**: Well, he's probably not going to be able to show up tomorrow if we're pouring concrete.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Not going to be any time left in the, in the day.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jdawson**: Well, and I didn't know if maybe when he wanted to start on some demo or something tomorrow.
**Bclymer**: Of that, that curve.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: There's like, there is some things that he could, like that we could get him to, to start on, but I definitely would want to wait till after that concrete is out of that truck and then, you know what I mean?
**Jdawson**: Because we bring him in there early, then Rick May then shoot up the flare, call that concrete truck, say we're out of here.
**Jcurtin**: Screw y'.
**Jdawson**: All.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Just gonna pull up job planner pictures real quick.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, let me know Are you going there tomorrow, Jesse?
**Jcurtin**: I'm flying out today.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, I'll be flying out today.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: So I'm gonna be offline after probably three more hours.
**Jcurtin**: They'll be offline for the rest of the day.
**Jcurtin**: So that's.
**Jcurtin**: He's.
**Jcurtin**: He's all set up because that picture from Friday, he's got his forms up to pour that under that canopy.
**Jcurtin**: Is that where he sits right now, is he's just got those forms up and we're waiting for concrete?
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I imagine he's gonna throw some more.
**Jdawson**: Some more rebar in that.
**Jdawson**: In that pour there?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, he said he's gonna stop by this afternoon to finish forming and then he's going to pour tomorrow around 10.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, so what are the odds we can get United there like lunchtime?
**Jcurtin**: Because is this guy going to be pissed off if they're out removing in the back curve?
**Jcurtin**: In the back?
**Bclymer**: He would be, yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Rick.
**Jdawson**: Oh, yeah.
**Jdawson**: If we.
**Jdawson**: If we mobilize United at the same time, Rick's.
**Jdawson**: He'll knowing he'll call the concrete, cancel it and pack up and leave.
**Jdawson**: So we just bait him long enough to get that.
**Jdawson**: Get that poured and then bring United in here.
**Jdawson**: And.
**Jcurtin**: So if.
**Jcurtin**: If Rick pours this tomorrow morning and theoretically, say United comes in and they.
**Jcurtin**: They come in at lunch, is that still out of the possibility of getting your inspection Thursday?
**Jdawson**: That would be a question definitely for Zach.
**Jdawson**: If he could.
**Jdawson**: If he could guarantee that, that to us.
**Bclymer**: But also maybe the concrete trucks would show up late or something happens.
**Bclymer**: I think it would be risky to schedule United.
**Jcurtin**: Do you think it's a risk we have to take, given where we're at, or do you think is how much of an impact is pushing that inspection back at Dago.
**Jdawson**: Have?
**Bclymer**: I don't think it's major.
**Bclymer**: Pushing it back one day.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: We definitely need to look into that impact.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Because they're.
**Jcurtin**: They're set up to start moving in and everything, right?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: What was their plan, Jack.
**Jdawson**: As far as the.
**Bclymer**: They're moving?
**Bclymer**: And I know you've been talking.
**Bclymer**: I think you've been talking to Andrew.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, he wanted to start moving some.
**Jdawson**: He wanted to start bringing in more material this weekend.
**Jdawson**: As soon as we get the tc, if we get the TCO on Thursday or Friday is when they wanted to start bringing some more stuff in over the weekend.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, so their plan is the weekend.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: So Friday is kind of our inspection contingency day.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: I originally was day in case something were to pop up and then we go, okay, well, we have The Friday of a little bit of wiggle room to move it back one day.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: So I'm just writing this out.
**Jcurtin**: So first thing we got to do is complete forming under the canopy this afternoon.
**Jcurtin**: And then the next thing that's going on under the canopy is pour under the canopy tomorrow at 10, right?
**Bclymer**: Yes.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: And then we have demo the pavement out in front of.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we do have to saw cut the pavement.
**Bclymer**: Yes, saw cut and remove.
**Jcurtin**: By the canopy.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: And then he also has to demo a curb on the north drive.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: He's gonna asphalt those areas at the same time, I would imagine.
**Jcurtin**: Is that north drive?
**Jcurtin**: Is that the alley?
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: And then we're paving that canopy.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, paving around the canopy area and then paving that.
**Bclymer**: That north drive.
**Jcurtin**: But.
**Bclymer**: But they would also have to form up the curbs.
**Bclymer**: So have to discuss if.
**Bclymer**: If we want to start doing that the.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, we'll talk with Zach and if it's not feasible, then maybe we just leave it for now until the next inspection.
**Jcurtin**: For the Ms. For the curb and we can just back for it.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: And then what I was going to.
**Bclymer**: Say, Jack, are there any other critical items like inside the building?
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, that's next.
**Jcurtin**: We got.
**Jcurtin**: Because we got that scaffold and then we got that dock pit and the tile.
**Jcurtin**: Jack, you're on mute.
**Bclymer**: Jack, are you still there?
**Jdawson**: Hello?
**Bclymer**: Yeah, hey, Jack.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I don't know what happened.
**Jdawson**: Same old service dropping.
**Jdawson**: Did I miss any questions that were shot my way?
**Jcurtin**: I'm just typing a couple of things out.
**Jcurtin**: So we got to finish the masonry at the dock door.
**Jcurtin**: That high?
**Jcurtin**: Shit.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so they worked yesterday and they're at the point to where now they're ready for the welder, which he's supposed to be here today, he said.
**Jdawson**: And that was.
**Jdawson**: He didn't have an exact time for me yet.
**Jdawson**: I'm gonna follow up with him after this meeting, see if the welder has maybe showed up here in the next.
**Jdawson**: If he's shown up in the past 30 minutes or so, but.
**Jdawson**: And then they're expected.
**Jcurtin**: Can't you see his truck outside or anything?
**Jdawson**: Who?
**Jcurtin**: The welder.
**Jdawson**: I don't know.
**Jdawson**: I've never met the guy.
**Jcurtin**: Oh, it'd be.
**Jcurtin**: His truck would probably be easy to see.
**Jcurtin**: It's gonna be funny looking utility.
**Jcurtin**: It'll probably be a funky looking utility truck with a welder on the back.
**Jcurtin**: See.
**Jdawson**: Now I don't.
**Jdawson**: I don't see.
**Jdawson**: I don't see him.
**Jdawson**: But they're expecting him today.
**Jdawson**: He's just not sure what time and then they said that they're expecting to start breaking down that scaffolding no later than Wednesday.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, so breaking that down.
**Jdawson**: Yep, breaking it down.
**Jdawson**: Being done, done walking out of there come Wednesday.
**Jcurtin**: And then we got to foreman pour the dock p.
**Jdawson**: Say that again, Jesse.
**Jcurtin**: We got.
**Jcurtin**: We got a foreman pour the dock pit.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, and when do we planning to do that?
**Jdawson**: That's going to be a question for Zach.
**Jdawson**: It sounded like from our conversations on Friday that he was expecting to start on that come next week and then.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, I don't think he locked in.
**Jdawson**: I didn't talk to Zach.
**Jdawson**: He talked to Jesse Dawson.
**Jdawson**: I think he.
**Jdawson**: He expected to be done with it by the end of next week.
**Jdawson**: And then because they got to have it operational no later.
**Jdawson**: But then by the 8th is what I remember we were talking about on Friday, September 8, they got to have it operational to start using that dock leveler.
**Jdawson**: And then the week of the 8th is where it'll then become a coordination.
**Jdawson**: Once we find out how many deliveries exactly Goodwill has that week, then I can start coordinating the framers to do the ceiling up high and the electricians.
**Jdawson**: But the before the 8th, definitely the pit and everything has to be done.
**Jdawson**: And also the apron out in front of the pit.
**Jcurtin**: So that's the ceiling of the loading dock there, right?
**Jdawson**: Yes, sir.
**Jcurtin**: The coordinate framers.
**Jcurtin**: Yep.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, so we can 9, 8 coordination with the Jeep goodwill delivery.
**Jcurtin**: So the framers can complete the ceiling at the loading dock and then for the canopy.
**Jcurtin**: Is that what you said at the.
**Jcurtin**: For the apron at the canopy?
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jcurtin**: Okay, so tell me if this looks like what we need to do through.
**Jcurtin**: Through finishing everything.
**Jdawson**: Complete forming underneath canopy this afternoon.
**Jdawson**: Pouring under canopy.
**Jdawson**: Tuesday 10:00am Yep.
**Jdawson**: Saw cut and remove pavement by canopy demo curb on the north drive.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So those two items right there.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Updates to be.
**Jdawson**: I guess we're back and forth if we want to wait till Wednesday for sure or try to bring in Zach Tuesday afternoon.
**Jdawson**: There's our two options there.
**Jdawson**: And then I guess if we do Tuesday afternoon, we worry.
**Jdawson**: Generally the concrete trucks have always been on time.
**Jdawson**: I hope we wouldn't have that bad of luck that then all of a sudden the last truck we need is.
**Jcurtin**: Well, here's what I'm worried about is I'm worried about Rick not showing up this afternoon and he's leaving that buffer in the morning for his catch up time to come and form that shit.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's super valid of a like assumption for sure.
**Jdawson**: 100%.
**Jcurtin**: And then how easy is this inspection to move around, because I usually if you call and try to change an inspection before you have it, you're not going to have it.
**Jdawson**: Are you talking about the TCO one?
**Jcurtin**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: If we needed to change it, I'd say that it'd have to be within the next hour just for us to be safe, that there's even something still available for Friday.
**Jdawson**: They have been flexible about changing, but as far as anything even being available Friday, we'd have to jump on that, make that decision soon before they get booked up, because it's moving.
**Jdawson**: So a lot.
**Jdawson**: A lot of other contractors are going to be trying to schedule things.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: And then when.
**Jcurtin**: When do we have closing in that dock door opening and the tile work happening?
**Jdawson**: Closing it in as far as, like, all the way to the point where we're installing a door?
**Jcurtin**: Well, we still have activities there, obviously.
**Jcurtin**: We have.
**Jcurtin**: Is that for the next inspection or is that for this TCL this week?
**Jdawson**: What's.
**Jdawson**: What's that?
**Jcurtin**: Getting the, like the overhead door and everything installed as a loading dock.
**Jdawson**: Really?
**Jdawson**: They were scheduled for today.
**Jdawson**: I told them kind of what's going on.
**Jdawson**: They said, that's fine.
**Jdawson**: We've taken it off.
**Jdawson**: Just let us know when you're, you know, when you're more set in stone for an exact date.
**Jdawson**: So I don't want to play too back and forth with them and be like, hey, schedule me again, and then cancel on them again.
**Jdawson**: So I haven't rescheduled anything for them as of right now until Zach can give us an exact date of when he'll have the pit and the apron poured and done.
**Jdawson**: If, If.
**Jdawson**: If Zach's saying that, hey, it'll be done by the fifth, then that's another thing that I'm going to look into, trying to coordinate is an install day of the overhead door for that week of the 8th.
**Jdawson**: But I don't know if, like, maybe if Zach is planning to hit the ground running next week, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and wrap it up, then I have a window of Thursday and Friday to get the door guy in there and slap a overhead on it.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: And then what about the tile inside?
**Jdawson**: Tile inside?
**Jcurtin**: Isn't there some.
**Jcurtin**: Isn't there some floor tile or something that's going inside here?
**Bclymer**: We're pouring concrete.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it's just gonna be concrete.
**Jcurtin**: Oh, that's just concrete.
**Jcurtin**: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Jcurtin**: I thought you said something.
**Jcurtin**: We had to close that in for the humidity, to turn the AC on to do tile.
**Jdawson**: And if.
**Jdawson**: If Zach.
**Jdawson**: Oh, oh, the.
**Jdawson**: The tile drop.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So we slapped plywood.
**Jdawson**: I Had them slap plywood up on Friday on T M. So.
**Jdawson**: Okay, Hvace H Vac is here now cutting AC on and Glenmark has started on dropping tile today.
**Jdawson**: I have, I have pulled them off to do something else that makes more sense for the EEPIS guy that they didn't get done on Friday.
**Jdawson**: And then, and then he'll be almost wrapped up with dropping tile today.
**Jdawson**: So that's good to go.
**Jdawson**: So that that overhead door won't hold us up from putting tile in the rooms or anything or getting AC on back on since we.
**Jdawson**: We closed it up with plywood.
**Jcurtin**: You need me for anything?
**Jdawson**: Where you got.
**Bclymer**: The concrete guy rescheduled for tomorrow.
**Bclymer**: We're going to talk to United and see what we we can work out.
**Jcurtin**: Well, but they need to start when.
**Bclymer**: To get a Thursday inspection.
**Bclymer**: They would have to start tomorrow.
**Jcurtin**: We'll start Wednesday then.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, I have a Friday inspection.
**Jcurtin**: But we can get our inspection if we have to on Monday.
**Jcurtin**: Remember we went over those dates that Andrew agreed to.
**Jcurtin**: They don't have to start moving in until the third.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: So.
**Jdawson**: Monday might be Labor Day.
**Jcurtin**: I think Tuesday is the second.
**Jcurtin**: Wednesday is the third.
**Jdawson**: We'd have to get it Tuesday.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: All right.
**Jcurtin**: Sweet.
**Jcurtin**: Sweet.
**Jcurtin**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Wednesday's the third.
**Jcurtin**: Way to go.
**Jcurtin**: Perfect.
**Jdawson**: So Andrew did, did agree that he won't move anything over the weekend on the 30th and 31st, it sounds like.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, that's what Jesse said.
**Jdawson**: Perfect.
**Jcurtin**: All right.
**Jdawson**: Which.
**Jdawson**: That's the most recent conversation.
**Jdawson**: The conversation he had with me was before he talked to Jesse, which is when he was talking about moving in over the weekend.
**Jdawson**: So it sounds like that he backed up on that.
**Jdawson**: And they'll wait till the third.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, that's helpful.
**Jcurtin**: We just don't want to lean on anything.
**Jcurtin**: For sure.
**Jcurtin**: So would it help for me to send this to you guys and we can fill it in?
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, that'd be perfect because I mean this is basically what.
**Jdawson**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Waiting on welder welding so measuring can continue.
**Jdawson**: Concrete access breaking down and demo by Wednesday.
**Jdawson**: Form and poor dock bit TBD dates per Zach complete next week.
**Jdawson**: Fully operational by 98 week of 98.
**Jcurtin**: Yep.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it's right on the money.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: I think just the short form like this is going to help us be more detailed at tracking this stuff because we need to be hounding the shit out of these guys for sure.
**Jcurtin**: So I got another meeting in in three minutes, but are we good on what we need to do?
**Jcurtin**: So we've got a loose commitment out of Rick that he'll be there today.
**Jcurtin**: So, Jack, if you don't see him by, like, right after lunch, within a half hour after lunch, let us know for sure.
**Jdawson**: I'll reach out, definitely.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: And then, yeah, let's try to connect with United and talk through everything with them.
**Jcurtin**: And then I'll be available for a couple more hours yet, so if anything comes up, but it's probably going to be easiest to text me.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: And then, Nick, you got that message I sent you about those two change orders, I see.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, sent that through.
**Jcurtin**: Okay.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: Cool.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, let's just stay on top of this stuff and make sure we're calling everybody we need to call and sit back if there's an issue.
**Jdawson**: So, as of right now, would we like to keep the TCO on schedule for Thursday at noon or go ahead and lock in a rescheduled date and time?
**Jdawson**: We.
**Bclymer**: We can definitely.
**Bclymer**: I don't think we should do Thursday, but Friday.
**Jcurtin**: What's.
**Jcurtin**: What would Tuesday hurt?
**Jdawson**: I don't think it hurt.
**Jcurtin**: What's that?
**Bclymer**: The only thing is, if they asked us to change some things, that would give us a day to do that.
**Bclymer**: But did you think Tuesday is better?
**Bclymer**: Jesse.
**Jcurtin**: I.
**Jcurtin**: Given how everything's going, I'd hate to reschedule it again on them.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Jcurtin**: Right.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Yeah, let's do Tuesday then.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: If that doesn't hurt anything, that's.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, I think that's the best bet.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Perfect.
**Jdawson**: I will.
**Jdawson**: I'll reach out and get that rebooked.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah.
**Jcurtin**: And then just from the sake of the subs, that inspection is first thing Tuesday morning, you know, so they can't be like, well, come button up before the inspection Tuesday morning for sure.
**Jcurtin**: So they need to be done by the end of the day on Friday.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Now, I'm still gonna.
**Jdawson**: I. I'm honestly probably gonna keep it that.
**Jdawson**: I mean, I probably won't tell.
**Jdawson**: Like.
**Jdawson**: Like, fire alarm.
**Jdawson**: I'm probably still gonna make them.
**Jcurtin**: Oh, yeah, just keep them.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, just anybody that's not related to this concrete and asphalt.
**Jcurtin**: Yeah, just keep them under the impression that we're hammering Thursday.
**Jdawson**: Gotcha.
**Jcurtin**: I gotta jump.
**Jcurtin**: I got this other meeting.
**Jdawson**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: All right, let's go.
**Jcurtin**: Thanks, guys.
