**Ataylor**: Okay, guys, so let me share my screen.
**Ataylor**: All right?
**Ataylor**: AJ Also dollars.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, so they added some fire alarm.
**Jdawson**: They're asking me to now price this shunt trip breaker to make it happen.
**Gducharme**: But.
**Jdawson**: We are done with that project.
**Jdawson**: I just need to get the CO figured out.
**Jdawson**: Once we receive the fire alarm permit, we'll be able to close that out.
**Jdawson**: And what else?
**Jdawson**: Close out documents I gotta get done and then I'm gonna get this final PSR and this August billing wrapped up here in the next day or so.

**Ataylor**: Awesome.
**Ataylor**: Nick.
**Ataylor**: Aspire new Poor Richie.
**Kmass**: We received two payments.
**Kmass**: We're waiting on my last payment and I have the warranty document.
**Kmass**: I just need to send it to the owner.
**Jdawson**: How much more do they owe us?
**Gducharme**: So Nick, today we got a check for payout number one or January rather in March for Ridge Haven.
**Gducharme**: What else is outstanding on that one?
**Kmass**: I believe there's one for April for 26,000.
**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Goodwill Bloomington.
**Ataylor**: Nick.
**Kmass**: Yeah, we.

**Bclymer**: Thank you.
**Ataylor**: Alec.
**Ataylor**: Civa Consulting Building requirements.
**Njepson**: Yeah, one second.
**Njepson**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: So we were expecting the permit last Thursday.
**Njepson**: That was the date that was initially told.
**Njepson**: I've made daily calls to that township and not had a response.
**Njepson**: I talked to our sub out there.
**Njepson**: He's gonna be completing the work for us and he told me that all the conduit has already been installed and the wire pulled.
**Njepson**: Only work left to do is install a couple devices which he's gonna do the day of the inspection.
**Njepson**: But they can't schedule an inspection until we have the permit.
**Njepson**: So I reached out to him today to see if he's heard anything.
**Njepson**: No response.
**Njepson**: But unfortunately we're kind of in the hands of the township.
**Njepson**: So I'm just going to keep at it for now.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Thank you.
**Ataylor**: Anneling.
**Bclymer**: Nick.
**Bclymer**: Goodwill Carb.
**Ataylor**: Office Carb cut.
**Kmass**: We're scheduled to start concrete on Wednesday and I need to get a change order to goodwill for the asphalt.
**Kmass**: And I need to get a change order to the subcontractor for the asphalt.
**Bclymer**: Perfect.
**Ataylor**: Westfield Collective.
**Ataylor**: Glenn?
**Fireflies**: Yeah.
**Fireflies**: Westfield's got the big change order that we've been working on for the last month or so.
**Fireflies**: Was in last week and approved by the owner on Friday.
**Fireflies**: We are moving forward with all the things on that and updating our schedule today to account for the added work.
**Fireflies**: We're pulling our dry in date up by three weeks to give them more time to get our stuff inside completed with all the ads.
**Fireflies**: We're still waiting on a response from the city from our last email to them about the trail credit and the offer that we made them.
**Fireflies**: And then we're still.
**Fireflies**: We're currently trying to get in touch with the utility, the fiber optic utility, get that fiber optic box relocated.
**Gducharme**: You heard anything else back as far as the city paying for that fiber box move or not?
**Fireflies**: No, but Bart asked me to send him the email correspondence and stuff I have.
**Fireflies**: Are you okay with that?
**Gducharme**: He wants to send him what?
**Fireflies**: He wants me to send him the email correspondence I have with the city.
**Gducharme**: Regarding the fiber box?
**Fireflies**: Yes, regarding.
**Fireflies**: Yeah, the conversation that we had about us letting them know that it's there, them telling us that we need to pay for it, and then the, you know, the backup data on this, the timeline of the plans on how they reviewed it.
**Gducharme**: I don't know.
**Gducharme**: Is there anything in there that's paints us in a negative light?
**Gducharme**: I would have to read through it.
**Gducharme**: I don't know.
**Fireflies**: It's not really that.
**Fireflies**: It's just like we're trying to.
**Fireflies**: I don't know.
**Fireflies**: Brandon's already spoken with the city, but we're already dealing with them with the trailer thing on this.
**Fireflies**: And I just don't.
**Fireflies**: I don't know if we wanna.
**Fireflies**: I don't know if we want to irritate the city of Westfield anymore by going to the mayor and sending all our email documentation and having them go to the mayor and having the mayor come down to them.
**Jdawson**: And, you know, that's.
**Fireflies**: That's what I'm getting at.
**Fireflies**: So we can.
**Fireflies**: We can shelve it and talk it.
**Fireflies**: Talk about it on the side and you can give your thoughts.
**Fireflies**: I'll just show you what, what we have.
**Fireflies**: You think about it and let me know if you think it's a good idea for us to give our, you know, documentation to them to go that route.
**Gducharme**: Yeah, we'll have to look at it tomorrow morning when Jesse's there in Indiana.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Ataylor**: Thank You Glenn.
**Ataylor**: Cormagia.
**Ataylor**: Exotech disease.
**Ataylor**: Alec.
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Njepson**: So last week I was kind of jumping through some hurdles on Job Planner trying to figure out the invoicing process and some errors I was running into working with cash solved until today.
**Njepson**: Create a new invoice for August to I filled out the rest of their billing release some of the retainage, but now I'm encountering some errors on the final amount of retainage on this invoice that I had sent out for them for August.
**Njepson**: So hoping to have that result by.
**Gducharme**: The end of the day.
**Ataylor**: Thank you, Alec.
**Gducharme**: Aspires and Lucy Nick Aspires said the.
**Kmass**: Invoices are still being processed and they need to go go through approval process with aspire.
**Bclymer**: Thank you.
**Ataylor**: AG Neiman holding FedEx.
**Jdawson**: That grid.
**Jdawson**: Starting this week we're going to finish up our other entrance as well.
**Jdawson**: For concrete we had to get one entrance done first.
**Jdawson**: That way we would still have access when they pour the second entrance.
**Jdawson**: What else?
**Fireflies**: What else?
**Jdawson**: Talked with James Manhart.
**Jdawson**: Who he does all the construction management for FedEx.
**Jdawson**: Waiting on a couple answers from them as far as electrical expectations go.
**Jdawson**: And so tomorrow we have our bi weekly meeting and we'll just go through that at 10 o' clock tomorrow.
**Gducharme**: That's about it.
**Ataylor**: Then.
**Jdawson**: Bill Theater Yeah, so I met with Bill on site on Friday.
**Jdawson**: I was able to get some answers.
**Jdawson**: I printed out some Lowe's finishes for him to choose from and picked up the check from them.
**Jdawson**: So this week we're going to finish scanning the floor and get our casing and base finished up.
**Jdawson**: Jose.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, they did pay us.
**Jdawson**: I think Brandon deposited the check on Friday and we need to get a check to Andreas.
**Jdawson**: He needs some money and so if you don't mind putting on accounting's radar to get that check cut.
**Jdawson**: Like tomorrow would be great.
**Jdawson**: It's already in there in Job Planner.
**Jmendez**: Okay, I will check it this moment.

**Gducharme**: Okay.
**Bclymer**: Perfect.

**Jdawson**: We're gonna continue on with our power to the vavs.
**Jdawson**: And then we got to get our spiral duct finished above the hard lid, which is going to be tomorrow.
**Jdawson**: And then we'll call for above ceiling inspection.
**Jdawson**: Be able to close that up.
**Jdawson**: I owe them a change order for the VAV move and also a change for the farm door and a couple other things that we're pulling out of contingency.
**Jdawson**: So I gotta catch that up here for this August billing.
**Jdawson**: I also need to get the schedule Updated.
**Jdawson**: It didn't really affect us too much.
**Jdawson**: But I'm using their change above the hard lid to push our schedule back another week.
**Jdawson**: So I got to get that done before we meet tomorrow at at one o'.
**Jdawson**: Clock.
**Jdawson**: Candace flying in in the morning.

**Jdawson**: She hasn't quite figured out that she needs to use job planner.
**Jmendez**: She's been.
**Jmendez**: She's been doing it on Avon and Brownsburg.
**Jmendez**: I'm not sure.
**Bclymer**: Maybe she's not.

**Jdawson**: Yeah, that's my fault.
**Jdawson**: That should be on Godiva.
**Bclymer**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: Maria, I'm going to change this estimator to.
**Jdawson**: I'm going to put me and Keba on there because we're tag teaming it.

**Jdawson**: I'm trying really hard to get everything done this week.
**Jdawson**: On it.
**Jdawson**: I mean, JP keeps adding stuff.
**Jdawson**: We owe him some pricing.
**Jdawson**: So these jobs have a tendency to linger on as they need more and more stuff done.
**Jdawson**: So I still.
**Jdawson**: I. I bumped him today.
**Jdawson**: Kev, I think I copied you on it.
**Jdawson**: I'm gonna start hounding him for these final POS because we have a couple approved change orders out there, but no PO to bill against, so.
**Jdawson**: Waiting on that.
**Jdawson**: That's why, if you see, my PSR is done, but my August billing isn't because I'm just gonna hold out a couple more days for him to try to get me a PS or a PO and then I'll send those bills out.
**Jmendez**: Aj, that.
**Jmendez**: That quote from Christian does have the.
**Jmendez**: The crossbar already.
**Jdawson**: Say that again, sorry.
**Jmendez**: The quote from Christian, it does already include the crossbar.
**Jdawson**: I know, but.
**Jdawson**: So there's two gates I don't think he included for two crash bars.
**Jdawson**: Okay, so there's an existing gate on the east.
**Jdawson**: East end of that keba.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, and then we're adding that one gate in the photo and they want to crash bar on that existing gate.
**Jmendez**: Gotcha.
**Jmendez**: Okay.
**Jdawson**: And then we'll get approved for it.
**Jmendez**: Okay, I'll let him know.
**Jdawson**: It should be like 1500 bucks or something.
**Bclymer**: Okay, thank you guys.
**Ataylor**: Aspire to see me Nick.
**Gducharme**: To get.
**Kmass**: The warranty document for the owner and also waiting on owner payment.

**Jdawson**: We build in full for the original amount.
**Jdawson**: I'm waiting on the PO for the added guardrail so I can bill against.
**Gducharme**: That.
**Jmendez**: AJ on the under closeouts.
**Jmendez**: Joanna sent an email asking about the date to confirm.
**Jmendez**: I think you said the 12th, but they say they were on site on the 2nd, so she wanted to confirm before she writes it.
**Jdawson**: They were on site on the 2nd.
**Jdawson**: Meaning August 2nd.
**Jmendez**: No, July 2nd.
**Jdawson**: If they want to put July 2nd, that's fine.
**Jdawson**: We just.
**Jdawson**: We've still been doing work there.
**Jdawson**: So, like my substance, does that work?
**Gducharme**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: My substantial completion Keba is August 12th.
**Jdawson**: That's when the project.
**Jdawson**: That's when we installed the last of the guardrail.
**Jmendez**: Gotcha.
**Jmendez**: Okay, I can confirm that date with her then.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Gpc Harrisburg.
**Bclymer**: Alec.
**Njepson**: Yes.
**Njepson**: So gpc, it was working on the pay application this morning.
**Njepson**: Since it's accounting for invoice, just waiting for response Back on that.
**Njepson**: Got owner instructions on who to send that to for payment once we have that ready.
**Njepson**: I submitted the drawings for permit last Thursday to the East Hempfield Township.
**Njepson**: Fifteen working days is what they told me to expect.
**Njepson**: So doing the math on that from last Thursday, we should expect it back by September 12, but I will monitor that for sure.
**Bclymer**: Perfect.
**Ataylor**: The rolling home sneak on Wednesday.
**Kmass**: The subcontractor is going to fix the silk fence and then I'll call in a final inspection for Thursday and I need to fill out forms for Duke Energy to energize the temp power poles.
**Ataylor**: Sounds good.
**Ataylor**: And make Goodwill storefront modifications.
**Kmass**: We received dates from Goodwill regarding when the schools are on break.
**Kmass**: So I need to write subcontracts and schedule those subcontractors.
**Bclymer**: Okay.
**Ataylor**: Any other projects that we need to add here, guys, before we move on to estimating.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, Maria, down below and estimating, okay.

**Fireflies**: I know.
**Jdawson**: Jesse Dawson, what do you think?
**Jdawson**: Because they're going to be.
**Jdawson**: They're doing a couple of these.
**Jdawson**: You want to track it all under one job.
**Jdawson**: Is it going to be a separate PO for each one like we usually do.
**Jdawson**: But there's no sense in creating, you know, four different jobs all for $10,000.
**Jdawson**: Right.
**Gducharme**: You'll just do like an owner change order for each one they add.

**Jdawson**: That should have been 8.
**Jdawson**: 25.
**Jdawson**: 25, not 7.
**Ataylor**: Yeah, I was like it took you a month for a meeting.
**Ataylor**: Ad what?
**Bclymer**: Okay, good, perfect.
**Ataylor**: Good luck at the meeting.
**Ataylor**: GWCW Allison Grove Retail Store Jesse.
**Gducharme**: Still waiting to hear back.
**Gducharme**: They're trying to get the leases worked.
**Bclymer**: Out.
**Gducharme**: And if they get that done then they'll release this on design.
**Ataylor**: Okay, sounds good.
**Bclymer**: Perfect.
**Ataylor**: GW Kokomo Retail Store Deck, this is you as well, right Jesse?
**Gducharme**: Yeah, it's the same.
**Gducharme**: Same thing.
**Gducharme**: I got to get the lease negotiate.
**Bclymer**: Okay, perfect.
**Ataylor**: And the last one.
**Ataylor**: Eye surgeon's office remodel.
**Bclymer**: AJ.
**Jdawson**: Yeah.
**Jdawson**: So they're wanting to expand their empty into their empty storage space on the second floor.
**Jdawson**: We had already done their new surgery center on the second floor, but half that second floor was unoccupied, so they're going to be expanding.
**Jdawson**: We need to get a design proposal together.
**Jdawson**: I already reached out to dkgr.
**Jdawson**: I should get that here probably tomorrow.
**Jdawson**: And then I'll shoot a design proposal over to Tina with Brandon, and we'll go from there.
**Jdawson**: Be some good, good winter work up here in Indiana.
**Ataylor**: Sounds good.
**Jdawson**: Unlike you Florida guys.
**Jdawson**: We got a plan for.
**Jdawson**: For winter work.
**Jdawson**: Sometimes.
**Gducharme**: It'S already winter there as far as I'm concerned.
**Jdawson**: Yeah, it was 50 degrees this morning.
**Gducharme**: O.
**Gducharme**: Well, that's the temperature they like to keep our office at up here, so.
**Jdawson**: I kind of understand football weather.
**Ataylor**: Okay, perfect.
**Ataylor**: Guys, any other estimate job that we need to add?
**Gducharme**: It is important that football season has officially started, so it will be much brighter.
**Jdawson**: Yes.
**Jdawson**: Don't call me on Sunday.
**Jdawson**: I'll have my butt parked in front of the TV watching nine hours of commercial free football.
**Ataylor**: Wow.
**Gducharme**: I thought it was because you'd be lamenting your team's loss the day before.
**Fireflies**: No, no, no, no.
**Jdawson**: Nothing but good vibes.
**Ataylor**: Okay, guys, any other projects we need to add?
**Bclymer**: Nothing.
**Ataylor**: Speak now or forever hold your peace.
**Ataylor**: Sounds good.
**Ataylor**: That's good.
**Ataylor**: Okay, guys, so thank you for the meeting.
**Ataylor**: Don't forget to keep updating these.
**Ataylor**: And then if you have issues, you know, with lotion, you can always contact me just to help you with that.
**Bclymer**: Okay?
**Ataylor**: Thank you, guys.
**Gducharme**: Hey, everybody.
**Gducharme**: Just as a general note, I sent the email out today about the billings, so when you're doing your owner billings this month, should be easier to verify everything as far as the fee and insurance and all that.
**Gducharme**: And then I sent an email to Job Planner also on, like, why it exports reports different than, like, the cost report than what's in Job Planner.
**Gducharme**: It looks like it also has a difference in, you know, approved subcontractor invoicing versus what's shown on the budget.
**Gducharme**: So just when you're doing your PSRs, make sure you're looking at that.
**Gducharme**: And if they can't fix it, then you just comment one way or the other.
**Gducharme**: Like, the PSR should reflect the actual amount in Job Planner.
**Gducharme**: And if the budget you have to attach is different, you just note that, hey, this is printing out different numbers than what's actually in job planner, so keep that in mind.
**Gducharme**: Thanks.
**Gducharme**: There's no problem in getting your billings done early either.
**Gducharme**: Waiting till the last day of this week is worst case.
**Gducharme**: But to get them done, send them in earlier the better.
**Jmendez**: Sounds good.
**Gducharme**: Already got two owner pay apps done, so that's good.
**Jdawson**: Sweet.
**Jdawson**: Thanks, Jesse.
**Gducharme**: Thanks, guys.
**Gducharme**: See ya.
