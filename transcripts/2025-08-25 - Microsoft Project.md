**Acannon**: Hola.
**Acannon**: Hello.
**Aortiz**: How are you doing?
**Aortiz**: Well, I like your background.
**Aortiz**: What are you.
**Aortiz**: Looks like Germany somewhere.
**Acannon**: Somewhere nice.
**Acannon**: Yeah, nice.
**Aortiz**: Somewhere cool.
**Aortiz**: Good.
**Aortiz**: So Ashley, you know Ashley, of course, our new assistant for St. Petersburg.
**Aortiz**: So she's going to join too, just because she wants to know, obviously about Microsoft Planner.
**Aortiz**: But let me know what happened.
**Aortiz**: Like, what was the problem with this?
**Acannon**: Yeah, I.
**Acannon**: It was almost like it wasn't a part of the like package we pay for on my account.
**Speaker 2**: Try to get it pulled up.
**Acannon**: I'm syncing my.
**Acannon**: My old laptop with Ian's laptop.
**Aortiz**: Oh, that's why.
**Aortiz**: Yeah.
**Speaker 2**: So Michael, to figure it out on.
**Acannon**: This laptop, I'll have to turn around on the other.
**Acannon**: Hello?
**Aortiz**: Okay, let me know because maybe that's the issue.
**Aortiz**: So I can show.
**Aortiz**: What permissions do you have?
**Aortiz**: I just said you didn't have my marketing.
**Aortiz**: You didn't have one.
**Aortiz**: Right.
**Aortiz**: So let me save something.
**Aortiz**: Well, you don't have Planner.
**Aortiz**: I'll show you.
**Aortiz**: That's why.
**Aortiz**: So you can see my screen.
**Aortiz**: Correct.
**Aortiz**: So these are your permissions.
**Aortiz**: So you have Microsoft 365 as standard power automated.
**Aortiz**: But you need planner and project plan three.
**Acannon**: Yes.
**Aortiz**: Okay, 50.
**Aortiz**: Pay me 50 in cash.
**Acannon**: Damn, this is like a $300 day now.
**Aortiz**: Of course.
**Aortiz**: Okay, let me just set it right now.
**Aortiz**: So Ash.
**Aortiz**: So that could be one of the issues.
**Aortiz**: So because you are admin, so you can go, you know, to Microsoft administration and then add those licenses for them.
**Aortiz**: Okay.
**Aortiz**: So in this case, that's the issue with under.
**Aortiz**: So he doesn't have Planner.
**Aortiz**: So obviously it's going to ask us to purchase a license.
**Aortiz**: So it's already promoted.
**Aortiz**: That's fine.
**Aortiz**: So you can just buy it because he needs it and then that's it.
**Aortiz**: Super simple.
**Aortiz**: Okay, so this is the whole issue.
**Aortiz**: So after this, like, everything's good.
**Aortiz**: Yeah.
**Aortiz**: He's been so dramatic.
**Aortiz**: I mean.
**Aortiz**: Oh, I get it.
**Acannon**: It's Monday.
**Acannon**: That's something to complain about.
**Aortiz**: Exactly.
**Aortiz**: Okay, so can you try to reset or download again Planner?
**Aortiz**: Because now you have plannered in Project Plan 3.
**Speaker 2**: Perfect.
**Acannon**: My computer's just slow since I'm syncing everything on the other laptop.
**Speaker 2**: Sa something about panel level.
**Speaker 2**: You know, I was like, well, the slap on deck.
**Speaker 2**: What about the plumbing?
**Speaker 2**: It's like, dude, all those are sleeves.
**Speaker 2**: That has nothing to do with the panel line, just the electrical.
**Speaker 2**: Yes.
**Speaker 2**: You got run plumbing up in your ceiling for the patio tiling.
**Acannon**: So should that be in the Microsoft.
**Speaker 2**: Store.
**Acannon**: Just under project?
**Aortiz**: Yes, it should be.
**Aortiz**: Or you can go online and just try to download the desktop version of Microsoft Planner.
**Speaker 2**: It has the app on my computer.
**Speaker 2**: When I click on it, nothing pops off.
**Aortiz**: Did you.
**Aortiz**: Did you log in and log out or.
**Aortiz**: This is new, right?
**Speaker 2**: I'm just kidding.
**Speaker 2**: Makes no sense.
**Speaker 2**: Yep.
**Speaker 2**: Now, I saw your email.
**Acannon**: Well, this is going to take me a second.
**Acannon**: I should be able to figure out how to get it.
**Acannon**: If I don't figure it out, I'll shoot you guys.
**Aortiz**: If you don't, we will charge you extra.
**Aortiz**: That's fine.
**Aortiz**: Try just to.
**Acannon**: Yeah.
**Acannon**: Being slow.
**Speaker 2**: So.
**Acannon**: I don't want to hold you guys up.

**Aortiz**: The call isn't an issue.
**Speaker 2**: Boom.
