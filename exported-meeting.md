**0:**
Joining us there. You can't see. 
**1:**
Hey, Rick. 
**0:**
I can't see nobody. 
**1:**
Yeah, I leg out really bad when people screen share. If my camera's on Heather. 
**2:**
Okay. 
**1:**
I don't know if he's here. He's on mute. 
**0:**
I don't know if it's working. 
**1:**
Oh, there he is. Hey, Rick. 
**2:**
So we received your updated pay app, Heather, and we went through it and, well, we marked up some things that we want to go over with you. All right, I'll share my screen. 
**3:**
So. 
**2:**
One of the line items we looked at was the site work line item, which include the asphalt and the curbs. And that's worked out that we had done by another contractor. If we deducted this 9,000, we still wouldn't even come close to being able to cover the cost of the other contractor. 
**1:**
Heather, can you see what Nick is sharing? 
**0:**
Yes, I can, but it was my understanding off of work. You can't hear me. 
**1:**
Yeah, you might want to try shutting your camera off. 
**2:**
Yeah. Because it can lag. 
**0:**
Additional asphalt. Asphalt and curbs were not completed. Yeah, we deducted the asphalt and curbs part that we did not complete. I can understand that. Storm filters that you install. Asphalt install. And I took off the price of the asphalt. We already took that off, but we took out. We didn't put in. So I'm having to. I have to go over this with Rick again. 
**3:**
I'm here. Can you hear me? 
**0:**
Oh, there. Can you see it? 
**3:**
Yes, I'm here. Yeah. Our total price from JL Harden for all the asphalt placement, fine grade and everything, as I showed the other day from Hardin, was 3,500 square feet of paving, which is all the paving, including the extra paving that was added to change grade and the strip down the alley. And my estimate that I gave a copy to the guy that came up here from Phoenix, Arizona, Jesse. 
**1:**
That's me. I don't have a copy of that. 
**3:**
Okay, I can send it to you. And I left a copy with him. But our estimate from JL Harden was $16,500. 
**0:**
Yeah. 
**3:**
And that was for all the asphalt pavement. And that's what I credit you guys back. Let me get my. 
**1:**
Yep. 
**3:**
Give you credit of 16,500 off of the 42,000 for pavement. Credited the $3,750 back. We demoed the curb down the alley, and the 3750 was putting it back. I credited that back to you. Additional four pipe ballards. I credited back twelve hundred dollars for install, and then I credited back the 2620 for the core Drilling of the pipe bollards that couldn't be set due to the canopy footings being laid out wrong to begin with. And then we credited back the $20,000 for the dock leveler area pad and interior floor and apron replacement, which should have been a total credit back of about $45,070 to complete the work that was to be done. 
**2:**
Okay, so this one you're. You're disputing this one right here. 
**3:**
Which one's that? 
**0:**
But we did not do. 
**1:**
What did you say, Heather? Yeah. 
**3:**
Yes. 
**0:**
We already accounted for the credit for the stuff that we did not do. And Jesse and Rick went over this, and this is what they had discussed. 
**1:**
Yeah. And I'm just gonna reiterate what I told Rick on site, because this is me. This is Jesse Remillard, the one Rick. Hey, man. So I said, I'm not involved in this end of it. And Rick had to send all his documentation and the supporting information into who he sends his pay apps to to approve it and review it. 
**0:**
Yes. And that's what we did. 
**1:**
Yeah. Because everything on here says approved by Jesse. But that's me. And that's the conversation I had with Rick on site. 
**0:**
Yes. This is what we had. So this is what we did, what we signed, and this is what we agreed to. 
**3:**
Jesse was. Bill. According to what me and you had figured out that we had done and wasn't done, that was credited back. 
**1:**
So you explained everything to me. That was all you did. 
**3:**
Exactly. But our billing, when we sent it in, Jesse reflected what me and you had went over. Yeah. 
**1:**
And I said it had to be set in to be reviewed because I can't speak any of this stuff because like I said, when I got there, I had just gotten involved in everything. 
**3:**
I understand. And it got sent in. Now what's the. I guess I'm catching up here. What's the questions on what we had built? 
**1:**
So we didn't get the backup. So we're looking at all the numbers and we're asking. We're questioning these things because they weren't as completed as they're showing on here. But it sounds like Heather said, you guys have to revise this again and send it back. 
**0:**
No, this was the revised one. Yes, this is what we revised. This was for all the work that we actually completed. And I sent it back to you. This is the one. Yes. Nobody has discussed with me other. This is the first time I've seen it this. So to have a big meeting over. It would have been nicer to have somebody talk with me one on one to figure out. I can understand you guys installed your storm filters, the back charge for this canopy, the air with the conduit. We offered to pay that. That was a big, big discussion. In fact there was a big blowout where all my, my people were. So I was. It was not brought to my attention that I had to pay for that. So that was still needs to be discussed. 
**2:**
The conduit that you guys broke. 
**3:**
Hold on a second. Is Jack around in the conversation? 
**0:**
This right here at the very top says a leader received the bill. We didn't. We offered to dig the hole to pay for it and we conduit it doesn't cost $6,000. 
**3:**
I agreed to pay for the guy's time, the extra wire and conduit to put it back in. But I was not paying for the equipment they rented to do this because I had equipment on site and we had offered four times directly to dig it. Right then we were on site with an excavator. Jack, you remember me and you and the electrician's conversation. 
**4:**
Rick, can you hear me? 
**0:**
Yeah, this is. 
**3:**
Yes, I can hear you. 
**4:**
Yes. So yes, me, Rick and electrician all met. Soon as they brought it to my attention that they did talk with Kevin about digging it out after it was digged out. That they did offer to dig it out with their main excavator beams. Mini excavator had already been ordered and it was on site. They had a skid steer on the way. We immediately called off the skid steer. I agreed with Rick that if they can use their skid steer to backfill it, we'll do that and we'll get Dean's mini excavator off the site asap. Originally, Dean was going to end up keeping their mini excavator out there until the project was completely done. That price potentially could have been a lot higher. We act activate. We acted on it immediately. Once McCray let me know that they did talk with Kevin. No one brought any of this to my attention that these conversations were done with Dean. I really wish Rick, that some, someone out of your crew would have came to me immediately when it happened and said, hey, I just let the electrician know that we're willing to dig that. Please don't bring out any equipment. The electrician didn't bring that to my attention at all. It wasn't until after the fact when you got here, Rick, the next day when it was already dug out and you're like hey, what's wait, we'll do this. Wait. You know, I don't want to cover all this equipment charge and everything like that. So the price for the mini out there that I. That price is just for the. The mini that Dean brought out there to dig that hole. 
**0:**
It doesn't cost $6,000 for one day of a mini excavator. I can tell you that that doesn't. 
**1:**
Mean the guy's time. 
**3:**
Let's all get realistic here. $7,000 to fix a conduit. A one inch conduit with two wires in it. 
**1:**
29 hours. 
**3:**
We offer straight to the electrician several times. I've got an excavator right here. We'll dig it. We'll dig it. We'll dig it. 
**4:**
I. I really wish that you're. 
**3:**
Someone took on his own to get an excavator out there to dig it. That's on his cost, not mine. Guys. Get realistic. $6,600 to fix a piece of conduit. 
**1:**
29. Does anybody else in this. 
**3:**
In. In this group agree that it should cost $6,600? I think. 
**1:**
I think. 
**3:**
Could we. Is it. 
**4:**
Is it a possibility that we could circle back on the damages, the damage costs through deem and we just go through the contract work that y' all have given prices on. Could we potentially. Can we all agree on that or do we want to talk about the 6600 through through deem right now? I just want to make sure we also have enough conversations of. 
**1:**
Of. 
**4:**
The agreement between what's left out to pay y' all given Yalls contract and those prices. 
**3:**
Okay. We'll. 
**2:**
We'll send you the. The backup that we got from Dean. 
**4:**
Yeah, they did provide receipts of material that they got from Kirby as well. So we can. We could spend so much time as we like to kind of review that 6600. But if we can all agree we'll to go through the pricing that y' all have on your pay app right now. We can. We can circle back on the. On the deem damage charges. 
**1:**
That sound good. Send the backup for your shoring. It is fine. 
**3:**
Yeah. Of rental on the shoring. Yeah. Yep. 
**2:**
One of the items we have is the exterior additional rework due to the canopy moving. So that's the canopy moving south. And yeah, you guys were billing 100 for that. But you guys. You guys just did the demo and someone else did the additional asphalt. 
**3:**
Hold on, hold on. All you got to look at it as a lump together. The additional move to the south, the additional move to the west. All the asphalt came to approximately 3,500 square feet because my asphalt guy had had bid it at doing under the canopy and the whole thing. The square footage that was added by Mo by the elevation change made up the difference in me pouring concrete under the canopy. So my entire asphalt bill is $16,500. That includes the asphalt that was originally in the bid, up in the 48,000. It includes the regrade and moving of the asphalt. See, that regrade and moving of grades was not just removing that extra 900 square feet of asphalt. I had to. Everything up in grade. I had to bring in stone. I had to raise all the grades. I had to raise that inlet. So you can't just nitpick out the paving in those two other sections. The paving is all under the $16,500. I have a sheet right here that I gave you, Jesse, and I showed you where J.L. harden was going to pave everything. 3,500 square feet for 16,500. And that is all the asphalt credit back that I feel we owe you back. Because it's not all just asphalt and demo asphalt and demo asphalt and demo. There was raising the inlet. There was changing all the elevations of my stone. It was adding a bunch more stone in there. There was. There was more work than just, oh, we added 900 square feet. Why would I. Why would I charge you 14,000 to add 900 square feet? And that's where I took out credited off of the 48, $8,000. I credited the 16,500 in pavement. And that includes the pavement, all the pavement. I was going to do the. The move to the south, the move to the east. It was all under that. J.L. hardin, 3,500 square feet. 16,500. And I believe I left you a copy, Jesse, and I can forward you this copy I have right here. 
**1:**
And yes, you need to send all the documentation, Rick, like we talked about. 
**3:**
I thought I gave that documentation to Jesse, along with the sheet that we had agreed was credited and done. And then we built off of that build off of that. I. I can take a picture and show it to you and send it to you right now. What I thought me giving him copies was giving your company copies. 
**1:**
No, I sent a picture of the 703. 
**3:**
He was just there to. Yeah. Get it done. 
**1:**
You're talking to the guy you're talking about, Rick. 
**3:**
Pardon me? 
**1:**
You're talking to the guy that you're talking about. 
**3:**
That's why I'm saying I gave you the cop. That's Why I made you a copy of the paving agreement we had with J.L. harden and I gave you a copy of the spreadsheet, the actual 603, whatever it was. 
**1:**
And 703. 
**3:**
703. And figured that was going up the line. And you told me to bill it that way. 
**1:**
And I know I did not say for you to fill it that way, Rick. I said send in all your information and we'll review it because that's not my responsibility. 
**3:**
Told me to bill it that way and build my retainage. And you didn't know if I could put two bills in on the same month that you. That we would have to see whether I would have to do the retainage separately. 
**1:**
I told you to send it all in, Rick. And I look, because like I said, I'm not part of this. 
**3:**
I got you. 
**1:**
Everything you have, Rick. Just send it all in. 
**4:**
Simple enough, it sounds like that the. When we're. If we were to talk touch base on the quote, like the adjusting the grade, like. Yes, you adjusted the grade underneath the canopy. You raised the inlet, you added stone. I think on Alito side is where we're coming at it with around the perimeter of the canopy that you did fill in stone there. But the other contractor is the one who did the grading there. 
**3:**
Would. Hey, I didn't show you right here under J.L. harden's thing, it says final grade. They final grade, my grade. We had it close. I don't see where they would have brought in any stone. And if you're telling me they did, sounds like you're saying that they charged a whole bunch more money than 16, 500 to do the asphalt work and you're wanting that back from me. And like I said to you, Jesse, I, you know, as long as it don't cost me no more money. I have a quote right here for 16,5 to do all the asphalt there to grade it. Final grade it. I brought in stone. I brought in actually more stone. They probably had to take a little bit out at the end of the day. 
**1:**
They final graded it. You spread it. I was there. 
**3:**
Yeah. And I had it under J.L. harden's. I'm looking at right here. I brought it with me. I thought you had a copy of it too, Jesse. And it says right here, final grade. 
**1:**
Yes. 
**3:**
So. And I'll send it over. Yes, I will. 
**1:**
Yes, please. And send the detail for all the change orders that you have listed on here that we don't have any documentation other than these lines on this payout. 
**3:**
You mean the change orders? One through seven. 
**1:**
No, eight through 13. 
**3:**
Eight through 13 is. Hold on. 
**1:**
That's correct, Nick. Right. Seven is the last one we have documentation on. 
**2:**
I believe I got eight. 
**3:**
But. 
**2:**
We didn't have any official change orders for nine through 13. 
**3:**
Over. 
**0:**
Oh, I see what you're talking about. Well, those were discussed. 
**3:**
You guys discussed which ones were. Hold on, I can't. 
**0:**
And then Nick. No, you guys. You guys discussed those. And then Nick went on vacation. I tried to contact Jesse and try to contact you guys and send you the information that Jesse and Rick discussed. Nobody asked me for documentation for the credits that we gave you. Nobody asked for official change order. 
**1:**
Yes, I asked. 
**0:**
Rick tried to contact you. I've tried to contact you. No, you're saying all those exchange orders that you and Rick come up with, I don't understand what you need all the documentation. 
**3:**
Hold on. Documentations for the credits is what me and you discuss, Jesse. 
**1:**
Well, you need the paper trail. Rick, like I said on site that you keep pretending didn't happen is I'm not responsible for that. 
**0:**
Cruise 12 responsible first. Nick is the one responsible for giving me the change orders to sign change orders. He failed to give me the change orders that I sent to him. 
**3:**
I understand what you're saying. 
**1:**
I've only gotten one email from you guys total, but no one's ever called me on this. 
**3:**
Well, okay, so. So from my understanding me and use conversation, Jesse was irrelevant. 
**1:**
No, it's exactly like I said on site. You explained it and I said you need to send all this documentation into backup and to who you send your pay apps to. 
**0:**
He went on vacation. I tried to contact him and he was on vacation. 
**1:**
Out of office reply hat my cell phone number and my email and my name on it. 
**3:**
All right. All right. So that's all right. 
**1:**
Yeah. Please just put your stuff together, send it in. Okay. 
**3:**
Okay. All these change orders like credit back for not striping and sealing credit back. 
**1:**
For. 
**3:**
The core drilling we didn't do. So what documentation am I going to give you for that? I can give you the documentation for the $16,000 16,500 agreement we had with Hardin. But these other things are just credits for stuff that we didn't do. How am I supposed to give you. 
**1:**
Documentation for that change order with and listed out on it that both parties signed like everything else. 
**3:**
Well, I guess Jesse mean, you should assign this. 
**1:**
I. Rick, like I said on site, I don't sign anything. 
**3:**
So what was our conversation exactly? 
**1:**
Exactly what? I explained it to you on site. You were explaining it to Me, Rick, we're not going to keep going around in this circle. 
**3:**
I ain't either. What I'm saying is I thought when I sent in our invoice stating what we were crediting back to you and what it was for. What more documentation do you need? I'm crediting you back for the striping. And that's just pick one item. I'm crediting you back for striping. Maybe we shouldn't have listed it as a change order. Maybe I should have just listed it as a credit back. 
**1:**
You can list that stuff as not billing. 
**3:**
Trade you back something for something that we're not doing. How do you want that documented? 
**1:**
You can either put it in a reconciliation change order, you can roll it right up into the lines that you're referencing on the 703. 
**3:**
Well, I thought so if I just got rid of CO10, 11, 12, 13 and just put it as a line credit back, it would work. 
**1:**
Yeah. If you don't bill it in full. 
**3:**
That's what we were. That's what we did. We sent you a billing that billed out for the balance of what we agreed to, not what we didn't do. 
**1:**
Okay, so nine through 13 are all. 
**3:**
If it says credit. 
**1:**
Says nine is one of them. You don't have the line you're referencing on item six. Sorry. Yes, there it is. Yeah, that's. That's all the stuff you have. For that we need the other backup. 
**3:**
Okay. 
**0:**
9 through 13. 
**3:**
Okay. Not credit. Asphalt paving, impartial curb, item 5, credit seal, a reset dock leveler, item 5, credit. 
**1:**
And for your CO9, you just have those 2 costs split. Like you explained. Right. With the seal CO9, you have 2 values. One's underneath it, 1, 16, 5 on. 
**3:**
The line, one's for the asphalt paving. For the whole project, 16,500. I had no way to really break it out of the added on one. So leaving that in there and just showing that all the paving and all three sections that paving applied to, I had it being done at 16,500. And then the 3750 is for the balance of the curve down the alley that we didn't install. We demoed it. Makes sense. 
**1:**
Yep. So send your. Send the stuff you have. 
**3:**
Okay. I mean, it's like credit back for not doing the dock work is a line item three up there, which is the 20 grand in itself. 
**0:**
So one of the easiest way for me just to send in for a change order for those line items and then Nick sign it and send it back and then I can Send it. 
**1:**
Back to you, I guess, just like. 
**0:**
We did all the other exchange orders. So I don't have to go back and do all of these billings over. 
**1:**
Yes, and please include the backup for the asphalt and then for the shoring. 
**3:**
Okay, so those are because the rest of this back things that we didn't do that we're not finishing under this contract is a. Is like 13, 12, 11, 10 is just a dock leveler area. It's got a straight up item number. And then the paving will send you this estimate from our deal with Dale Hardin. And then I'll just put a little more, I guess I don't know how to do this. 3750 credit for the curb so that we didn't finish that. We did the rep, you know, we did partial the rest of the curbs. You want me to put that curb thing as another separate item we're not finishing. You know, it's just reduction because somebody else is finishing that part. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. I don't know how. Just talking about two sheets of paper, one from the paving company and one from the shoring company. 
**1:**
Yeah. 
**3:**
Two documents we're looking for, correct? 
**1:**
Yes. You said paving and shoring, Right. So what? 
**0:**
Yeah. Okay. 
**3:**
So then these other things like striping. 
**0:**
Because I have one for striping. 
**3:**
Yeah, there's. There's a deal for striping, but that was under a line item where, you know, it doesn't matter what we're paying for the striping. We didn't do the striping. So I credited back the whole line item for the ceiling and striping. Yeah. And then what's these green things? Well, the 4,000 on this, that's like explained. That's all under that pavement. What else is here? Did not perform core drilling. Yeah, that's what, that's where. We could not get a core driller guy in there for two weeks. So I hunted down, spent a whole day of my time to hunt down a core drill and it wasn't able. We got it, we went, we tried, we core drilled. It wouldn't perform. But our total cost for that was $580. And that's where that. That 580 that we build on part of the core drilling. And believe me, I have no qualms about the core drilling. 
**1:**
Was. 
**3:**
Should not have been. It shouldn't have been. We should have got surveyors in there to start with. Okay. We installed the storm hunters flavor because it covers the cost of the storm. 
**0:**
Storm inlet. 
**3:**
$250 $40. Okay. What we pay for those things, then we pay for the two ones. 
**0:**
They're just. They're saying they installed it, and so they want 240 credit. I'm not sure what I'm getting out of it. 
**3:**
You're on bigger. 
**1:**
They were delivered to the site and installed by us. 
**3:**
Yeah, well, we were supposed to provide them. Yeah, it's supposed to not go in until the project was totally done. But I'm not going to qualm over to. If that's that. You can have the $240. Additional asphalt install was performed. See, that asphalt all falls under that 16,500 for all the asphalt. And I took that and credited it back to you guys. And then asphalt and curves were not completed. We should not have to pay. See, I credited back the. The 19, the 16. 5 for the asphalt and the 3750 for installing the curb. And then that. That covers all of the all stuff, down to why this electric guy wants $7,000 fixed conduit. That's beyond me. 
**1:**
We'll get that. 
**0:**
Also where my. I'm also wondering where the. The payment due is from July. This has been way past July, and I have people that I still have to pay from that. They are hounding me, and they. They will put a lien on this. If I don't get the payment from you, I can't pay them. That was from July. That was okay and approved. Just never paid. Can you tell me where that is? It was for, like 27,378. My pay app was number two. 
**2:**
We'll meet with accounting after this meeting. 
**0:**
I've been told that now Nick from Nick for two, three weeks. And I keep telling my vendors that, but they don't accept that. So. I mean, you should have gotten something from them the first time I asked you. 
**3:**
After so many. Hey, after like, 60 days, our creditors want to slap liens on our project. And that's the problem with everybody says project progress payments, but unless you guys are billing every month, we're not getting our pay. And. And when we get strung out, because you guys ain't the only contractors we got. When we get strung out, 60 days, they start hollering liens. So. And then it becomes out of our hands. Because I'm not taking money out of my pocket to pay for your project, just to be honest. You won't pay for money. So that's the only reason why we're fairly concerned about the pay app that was already approved and is getting pretty stale at this point. 
**0:**
Yeah, it's quite old. 
**1:**
All right, got it. 
**3:**
So. 
**0:**
It'S a little bit frustrating. I can understand figuring out this repayment in those last one, but that one is. Needs to be paid as soon as possible. 
**3:**
We'll. We'll get you this paving thing sent to you and she'll get you a copy of the shoring thing sent to you. 
**0:**
I can send you back an invoice with those change orders giving you credit so we can. Nick can create change order for that. 
**3:**
Or do you just want us to take the change order numbers off of the credits? Because the credits refer to what were what items. You printed it. 
**1:**
Yeah, I would just take the change order numbers off. 
**3:**
Okay. 
**0:**
Would that be easy? 
**3:**
Okay. I think so. 
**0:**
All right. 
**3:**
Because it just shows it what we're not billing for. Okay, so then, so then the only thing outstanding there is dealing with this outrageous electric back charging. 
**1:**
Yeah, like I said. Well, send us what you got. We'll take a look at everything and get back to it. And then Nick will circle back with an answer on your pay app for July.

Okay, and then how do we want to address this 6600$, which I'll call a real fraudulent freaking back charge on that conduit. I've hit millions of conduits. It happens. One, it shouldn't been running right underneath the column. Yeah, it. It just, it stinks of blatant taken advantage of. 
**1:**
Really does send you the backup and you can review it. Rick. 
**3:**
Send it to me. And you know, I guess I don't know what happens when I dispute it. But yeah, yeah, my guy, as soon as he hit it, told him we would dig it. And he sat there right in front of Jack and he was told four times that we would dig it. And I had to call him out as a liar right then. And then he weaseled back around and said, okay, yeah, they told me. So like I said, I'll, I'll pay for his time, his material. I'm not paying for his, his excavation, his excavator. And we can, we can hold that money off to the side. I don't care. I'll fight it all the way to court because that no judge is going to sit there and look at me and say, well, you offered and he still tried to screw you over for this. You know, we play a lot of games out here between contractors, subcontractors and other subcontractors. I've done this for 45 years and you know, never had to be drawn into court. I've went to court for other people but when you get in court common sense and some reality does fall in. You can't just bill people for whatever the hell you want to bill them for. So if we got to stand that off to the side I'll review his his line item charges on that and I have no problem paying for what we did. I have a problem paying for somebody just trying to gouge us because 20% of $2,000 is $400 but 20% of $7,000 is a hell of a lot more. That's just not right. We're all out here trying to build these things for our customers and if, if we're going to run around and screw each other. Yeah that's it's just not right. That's what's making America. So we'll get you all this information, send us over that line item for the electrical back charge and see if we can't just get this resolved and behind us.
