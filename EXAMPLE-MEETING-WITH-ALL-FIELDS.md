**Date:** 9/19/2025, 10:00:00 AM
**Duration:** 45 minutes
**Participants:** jremillard@alleatogroup.com, njepson@alleatogroup.com, hmccray@goodwill.org, jdawson@alleatogroup.com

## Summary
The meeting addressed the coordination of the Tremont and Noblesville projects, confirming MEP design-build responsibilities with Darryl Jackson in charge, discussing structural requirements including SDS criteria and retaining wall issues, clarifying permit processes with both cities, and establishing timeline expectations for permit issuance and construction mobilization. Key decisions included confirming retaining wall design responsibility lies with Goodwill's civil engineer, establishing that structural permits can proceed independently of retaining wall approvals, and setting expectations for permit readiness by mid-October with construction start targeted for early November.

## Transcript

**Jesse Remillard:**
Good morning everyone. Let's start by reviewing where we are with the Tremont and Noblesville projects. Nick, can you give us an update on the design status?

**Nick Jepson:**
Sure. We've made significant progress on both locations. The MEP design-build package is nearly complete with Darryl Jackson taking the lead. We're looking at some specific structural requirements that need clarification, particularly around the SDS criteria.

**Heather McCray:**
From Goodwill's perspective, we need to ensure the retaining wall issue at Tremont is resolved. Our civil engineer has been working on this, but we need to confirm who has final design responsibility.

**Jesse Remillard:**
That's a critical point. My understanding is that the retaining wall design falls under Goodwill's civil engineer scope, not ours. We'll handle the structural elements of the building itself, but the site retaining walls are separate.

**Jack Dawson:**
I agree. We should be able to proceed with our structural permits independently of the retaining wall approvals. The city has indicated they'll review them separately.

**Nick Jepson:**
That's good news. It means we can maintain our timeline. Speaking of which, we're targeting mid-October for permit submission. That should give us approvals by early November, allowing mobilization shortly after.

**Heather McCray:**
That timeline works for us. We'll need to coordinate with our operations team to ensure minimal disruption to the existing stores during construction.

**Jesse Remillard:**
Excellent. Let's make sure we have clear action items. Darryl needs to finalize the MEP drawings by October 10th. Our structural engineer will confirm the SDS criteria for both sites by the same date.

**Nick Jepson:**
I'll coordinate with the permit expeditor to ensure we're ready for submission on the 15th. We should schedule a follow-up meeting for October 20th to review permit status and finalize mobilization plans.

**Jack Dawson:**
One more thing - we should discuss the budget implications of the recent material price increases. Steel prices have gone up significantly since our initial estimate.

**Jesse Remillard:**
Good point. Let's include that in our next meeting agenda. For now, let's focus on getting these permits submitted. Any other questions or concerns?

**Heather McCray:**
Just want to confirm - you'll send us the updated drawings by end of week?

**Nick Jepson:**
Yes, we'll have preliminary drawings to you by Friday for review. Final sealed drawings will follow once we incorporate any feedback.

**Jesse Remillard:**
Perfect. Thanks everyone for your time today. Let's keep the momentum going on these projects.
